We aim to record the plant species that grow wild in Werrington. We want everyone to help us record the plant species in each if the nine 1km squares that Werrington covers

1) Download the iNaturalist App. You can find out more at www.inaturalist.org

2) Under the Projects Tab, find Wildlife Friendly Werrington and press 'Join'

3) Whilst out on your local walks, via the app, take photos of the leaves and flowers you see (or upload your photos to the website)

4) The system will identify them for you and will record their location on the map

This is a GREAT way to find out more about the environment 
This will help guide local conservation management plans. We can’t conserve something if we don’t know it’s there!
This will help monitor change
This will add knowledge to national databases. The information you record will be deposited with the Botanical Society of British Isles.""";

What will you be doing?
Governing bodies are responsible for the strategic management of a school and will make decisions about a wide range of issues.

The core responsibilities involved are:
•	Ensuring accountability
•	Providing support and challenge to the schools senior leadership team
•	Monitoring and evaluating the school’s progress
•	Budgetary allocation and control
•	Shaping plans for school improvement and overseeing their implementation
•	Setting the school’s aims and values
•	Appointing senior members of staff including the Head Teacher
The governing body is usually split in to a small number of committees, each responsible for one area such as finance or pupil achievement. These committees will meet separately from the main governing body to discuss relevant issues in more detail. Discussion is then fed back at a full governing body meeting.
A school governing body is made up of representatives from the school, the parents, the local authority and the local community.

What difference will you make?
Governors make decisions that affect schools for years to come. Our recent impact survey found that our volunteers bring £9.9 million worth of value to schools each year, and 9/10 volunteers would recommend being a governor to a friend. 
As a governor, you can visit the school to gain an understanding of the culture and ethos and to get the most out of the role. You’ll also have the opportunity to meet children, parents, and teachers, and see the impact of your work first-hand.

What's in it for you?
Volunteering as a school governor is a challenging but rewarding role. As part of the governing board, you’ll:
•	help schools overcome challenges to ensure a bright future for children in your community
•	work collaboratively with people from different backgrounds, challenging your own perspective and broadening your network
•	gain experience outside of your job description and skills you can bring back to work""";

We need volunteers to assist with creative workshops for children. Responsibilities will include:

- Assisting Caudwell Children staff member(s) in running the community activity music and engagement sessions
- Help to ensure all children are safe during the activity sessions
- Support staff members with planned activities
- Participate in setting up an activity and helping with the set down
- Communicate and work with the children to ensure they have fun
- Contribute to and represent Caudwell Children as part of the ‘All Roads Lead to Alexander’ Commonwealth Games project
- Contribute to the legacy of the project within the community through legacy lifeskills sessions

                            :description """Sense Virtual Buddying volunteers make a real difference to supporting young people and adults who may be lonely or isolated.

Sense matches volunteers with disabled people to meet for an hour a week on Zoom, over phone, by email, text or letter writing. Our volunteers have spent thousands of hours with their buddies — learning new skills, having fun, and forming fantastic friendships. Sense matches each volunteer with someone who has similar interests, to make sure you have a great time. You and your buddy choose a time that suits you, and you can decide what activities you’d like to do together.

The Role of a Virtual Buddy

Sense matches each volunteer with someone who has similar interests to ensure you’ll have lots of fun together. Once matched with a buddy, you will get to know each other remotely via video calls, phone calls, texting, emails or through letters.

You’ll arrange weekly sessions and plan fun things to do together – what this looks like will be inspired by your mutual interests. You could be gaming, doing arts and crafts, playing music, seed planting – there are so many possibilities! We will provide you with weekly themed activities to help to support you in planning your interactions with your buddy.

We’ll also keep in touch with you to ensure you have all the support you need.

The programme is open to all volunteers who are 16 and over. You don't need to have previous experience volunteering or caring for disabled people. We welcome people from all backgrounds and with all interests.

What we can Offer You

Before you start your volunteering role, we’ll make sure that you’ve had the training you need to feel confident. This will be delivered online and via video call.

While you’re volunteering with us as a Virtual Buddy, you’ll get:

A written account of your volunteering and references if required
Reimbursement of pre-agreed expenses (up to £25)
Volunteering as a Sense Virtual Buddy is a great opportunity to develop new skills and get to know new people whilst making a real difference to a person’s life. 

Who we are Looking For

We need positive, empathetic volunteers who are passionate about supporting people with complex disabilities to communicate and experience the world. We are looking for volunteers who are great communicators and who are friendly, enthusiastic, positive and ready to have fun!

We’re also always looking for volunteers who have knowledge or experience of British Sign Language (BSL) and/or other communication methods like Makaton.

About Sense

For everyone living with complex disabilities. For everyone who is deafblind. Sense is here to offer personalised support to help people communicate and experience the world. We believe that no one, no matter how complex their disabilities, should be isolated, left out, or unable to fulfil their potential. Our experts offer support that’s tailored to the individual needs of each person, whether that’s at our centres, through our holidays and short breaks, or in people’s own homes. In addition to practical support, we also provide information to families, and campaign for the rights of people with complex disabilities to take part in life.

Volunteers add real value to Sense, bringing their passion, enthusiasm and fresh perspectives to the work that we do. We believe that volunteers enable us to bring people together, and provide opportunities for people with complex disabilities to communicate and experience the world.

We include. We collaborate. We find a way. We challenge. We celebrate.

If you have any questions regarding the role or would like some more information please contact the volunteering team at volunteer@sense.org.uk

We’d love for you to consider joining us as a Sense Virtual Buddy!""";

We are looking for volunteers who enjoy meeting and talking to new people and would be willing to help us set up a new group in their area.

What would I do?
Following the success of the new groups in Hertfordshire, we are recruiting volunteers across the country to set up new NWR groups in their area.

These NWR groups will meet for conversation and informal discussions in a local cafe or pub with a set theme – this theme acts as an icebreaker and ensures that no two meetings feel the same! Themes could cover a wide range of topics and are designed to be light-hearted and an opener for conversations that could lead anywhere (and usually do!).

Your role would be to run the meetings – greeting new and existing members, ensuring that the meetings run smoothly and everyone feels welcome, included and is having fun.

You would be asked to:
• Work with NWR staff to identify which town/city to base your group in
• Consider the types of women who would be interested in your group. What would suit them in terms of the time, location and format of the meetings? How should we communicate to them about the new group? Our staff will be able to provide guidance using their wealth of experience in setting up and running groups.
• Schedule meetings and identify and arrange a suitable venue.
• Run the meetings, ensuring that everyone is made to feel welcome and has an opportunity to contribute if they want to. Promote the benefits of NWR membership.

We will:
• Offer you ideas and advice in all areas of running the meetings and managing the group.
• Write and launch a social media and marketing campaign to recruit members for your group.
• Respond to enquiries and maintain lists of those interested in attending.

The amount of time spent will vary from week to week. It is estimated that it will require 2 hours a month. The hours are flexible and can fit in with your existing commitments.

This opportunity is open to women living in the UK over the age of 18 who are able to travel to the meetings in the evening.

Travel expenses will not be reimbursed.

You will be provided with full training and support from NWR staff and will be part of a friendly and supportive network of volunteers from across the country.""";

We are recruiting for experts who are enthusiasts in Minecraft to work on a 6 month Community Tech project – developing a Minecraft server for use by community groups who work with Neurodiverse children. Fully remote role.

We know the power that Minecraft has to change lives, and have seen it again and again in our Minecraft groups for children with SEND. We have seen confidence grow, friendships form, new opportunities open up for children, all due to the common ground and power of Minecraft in our Minecraft social sessions for children with SEND. Our sessions are so important to the kids who attend and they look forward to them all week – even taking their laptops on holiday to attend! 

Setting up a secure, private, Minecraft LAN gaming environment can be intimidating, confusing and expensive.  Parents are often unable to let their children play online when their children are more vulnerable.

This project will create a server capable of hosting private worlds for community groups, shared worlds and mini games, and teach community group leaders how to play and ideas to lead sessions for the children, and demystify the world of Minecraft and servers.

We are looking for people who have expertise in:

 

Minecraft server configuration

Plug in writing and management

Coding 

Minigame Building

World Edit

Command Blocks

 Master Builders

 

The aim of this program is create a resource that can be used by community groups to support the children’s wellbeing, education and building friendships. This six month period will be spent creating, developing, and testing ideas as part of a team, leading to the creation of a server than can support multiple community groups to have their own private space, along with common areas and mini games for children to meet safely and play together.  There will also be the opportunity to upskill community group leaders to lead their own sessions for the children on the server.

Volunteer Roles – Leading/Assisting Minecraft Build & Play Session

If you love playing Minecraft but might not have the technical skills above, we would welcome you to apply to join us to support the children in their social sessions – for a maximum of 6 hours per week (typically one hour per week), to assist or lead Minecraft Social Build & Play sessions with the groups, which take place daytimes, evenings or weekend mornings.

Any successful applicant working with children will be required to undertake an Enhanced DBS check and NSPCC Online Tutor Training, arranged by Creative Active Lives. """;

Essentially, we like to have volunteers on the reserve every day of the week. We are looking for people who can take on a regular shift walking the reserve,  keeping an eye out for maintenance issues while engaging with visitors in a positive and friendly manner. 

This role will include all of the following:
- Talking to members of the public about the reserve and the wildlife they might see.
- Supporting our 'Plovers in Peril' campaign to highlight the importance of shoreline habitats for beach nesting birds
- Checking paths, hides, benches and reporting issues back to the wider team. 
- Litter picking and sweeping hides
- Checking the car park machine and reporting issues back to the wider team
- Reporting inappropriate visitor behaviour. 
- Checking permits for special access parking area 
- Reporting visitor footfall 
- Supporting the wider team on high visitors days eg wader spectacles (dates and times for these will vary) by helping with parking, visitor flow and visitor engagement
- Where possible, this role is undertaken in buddy pairs

Training and support will be provided but for this role the following are essential: 

- Physically fit and able to be on your feet for 2-4 hours. 
- Good 'people skills', including diplomacy  
- Problem solving skills 
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team
- Good wildlife ID skills are advantageous but not essential

This is a really rewarding role set in a beautiful wildlife rich setting. The great outdoors will be your place of work and you will be able to take it at your own pace. By talking to visitors as you go along, you'll have the pleasure of helping people learn more about the reserve and the work of the RSPB, or just be a familiar friendly face to our regulars.  

You will be making a genuine contribution to nature conservation, and you might find it rewarding to safeguard nature in the area you are working to protect. You may be working alone in a remote setting or paired with another volunteer depending on our team capacity.

Our nature reserves are very special places for people and wildlife. Right across the UK the RSPB manages woodlands and wetlands, heathlands and meadows. A real mosaic of different kinds of habitats for a wide range of wildlife.""";

SSAFA branches rely on regular charitable income to fund all the necessities behind our support for clients. This includes volunteer travel expenses, phone bills, publicity, and grants for clients in urgent need.

We want our visitors to be welcomed with a warm smile and a friendly hello, in a well-kept, clean and full shop. By giving your time to this role you’ll be making a huge difference to the wildlife and habitat here at Fairburn Ings, as all our profits go straight back to helping nature. 

There's lots to keep you busy, so you’ll never be bored, here are some of the things you’ll be doing:
- Delivering excellent customer service, using the till and having a great knowledge of all our products so you can help each customer pick the right products. We will give you lots of training, but you need to be a real ‘people person’, chatty and friendly, approachable and with real enthusiasm for what we do.
- We have annual targets each year for our shop sales, so you’ll help us reach those targets. We also get mystery shoppers, so it’s important that you know the expected standards, to make sure we pass with flying colours!!
- We have lots of great events planned to let our visitors know about – each conversation is different so you can tailor each one and mention the things you think are relevant to that person.
- There is a small café as part of our shop, so we have plenty of checks to do each day to make sure we keep to our food hygiene standards.
- You’ll help us around opening and closing routines, with regular stocktaking, deliveries most days and there are various events you can get involved with too if you wish.
- You will talk to people about how they can support the RSPB and if you are interested, can even learn how to make new members for the RSPB, helping us gain more support and allowing us to do even more for nature.

This role is very rewarding. You get to meet lots of people, make new friends, and to top it all off you are working on a gorgeous nature reserve – what could be better? We need you and your enthusiasm to help our customers get the absolute best from their visit, if this sounds like you then get in touch now.

You can claim your travel expenses when volunteering, and you will be provided with a uniform and all the resources and training you need to undertake your role. You will have opportunities to learn new things and gain new skills and to learn about our reserves and the wildlife that is found here. You will need to undertake some essential online training, either at home or on site and you will be supported by a line manager and have lots of opportunity to discuss your role with them. 

**We also welcome applications from young people who are under 18 and wanting to gain volunteering experience. This is a great thing to add to your CV. Giving your time for something you believe in is a good thing to do, and makes you stand out against others when applying for jobs.**

This is an essential role to support the running of our shop, and therefore we do have fixed shifts to ensure we are able to operate as planned. These are: : 
Full day 9am to 4.30pm in winter and 5.30pm in summer,
Morning 9am to 1.00pm, 
Afternoon 1.00pm to 4.30pm in winter and 5.30pm in summer, 
Lunch cover 11.30am to 2.30pm. 
(full or half day shifts are available, we particularly need volunteers for Friday and Sunday afternoons)

                            :description """Rathlin Island is home to Northern Ireland’s largest seabird colony, with over 200,000 birds, including the largest Guillemot colony in the UK and Ireland and over 1,000 Puffins. However, these populations are under serious threat from invasive non-native predators—rats and ferrets—which prey on seabird eggs, chicks, and adults. 

Introduced unintentionally in the 1800s (rats) and deliberately in the 1980s (ferrets), these predators have significantly impacted Rathlin’s wildlife. For example, Puffin numbers have halved since 1985, with chick survival rates dropping from 75% in healthy environments to just 33%. The Corncrake, another vulnerable ground nesting bird, is also at risk. Rathlin remains the only breeding site for Corncrake in Northern Ireland. 

An incursion is when a non-native invasive mammal has recently spread to the island but has not yet established a population. As part of the shared protection plans, we are building a network of trained volunteers to respond to an incursion and react rapidly to any reported invasive predator and remove this threat as quickly as possible.  

**We will provide training and host occasional team days**, but you will **only be called upon in the event of an incursion**. We do not expect that everyone will be available all the time, but by having a large network of volunteers we aim to ensure that we have enough when needed. 

Depending on your skill set and interests there may be other tasks you can help the team with such as more regular surveillance checks, reviewing trail camera footage, constructing wooden rodent motels, or helping with maintenance and stock takes of hub equipment. Awareness raising is an important way of improving biosecurity, so any way you can help with this, be it through communicating with your friends/family or at a larger public event would be much appreciated.  

As a LIFE Raft biosecurity volunteer, you’ll be part of something big – a team of amazing and dedicated people who donate their time, energy, talent and skills to help birds and other wildlife. We will help you gain skills and give you an invaluable insight into essential biosecurity work.  

**What you will be doing**

- Routinely checking the permanent monitoring loops to see if there are any signs of rats. This means checking monitoring station based around Rathlin in the routes most likely to have a rat incursion.  

- Contacted if an incursion has occurred, likely at short notice.  

- Assist with practical on-the-ground incursion conservation work. This will involve the active control of invasive predators, by use of traps or rodenticide if there is an incursion. 

- You will be involved in setting out and checking equipment (monitoring/poisoning/trapping equipment) in the first 48hrs of any incursion response. 

*If you are not a Rathlin resident it will be possible to carry out day trips, you may also be required to stay on island, if necessary, accommodation will be provided. You will be working alongside other volunteers, RSPB NI staff and key stakeholders as a team.*

Other tasks you may have the opportunity to get involved with if you are interested include helping at events, reviewing trail camera footage, constructing wooden rodent motels, or helping with maintenance and stock takes of hub equipment. 

**The skills you need and the skills you can bring**

The Island incursion role is varied, and the list below is an example of the type of skills required but not all are necessary, there are other aspects to the role which may be more suited to you. Everyone will bring a range of valuable skills so come and have a chat with our Biosecurity Manager to see if this role is for you. 

- Follow procedures required for the removal of invasive predators and learn necessary monitoring skills required.  

- Able to attend required training and follow health and safety requirements. Work as part of a team of 3-8 people to carry out the main tasks.  

- Be flexible and adaptable to change. 

- Have a friendly nature and be able to communicate effectively with people.  

- Physically able to embark and disembark boats– including small tenders and where no hard slipway is present.  

- Comfortable moving across rugged terrain in all weathers, including slippery rocks, steep slopes and at a safe distance from cliff edges.  

- Be able to carry equipment across rugged terrain – as a minimum 5 – 10kgs (this would include personal equipment, food/drink, and incursion response materials).  

- Able to camp, if necessary and cook as part of a rota for other team members. 

- Maintain any equipment provided. 

- Carry out responsibilities in an environmentally aware manner, ensuring as little damage to the environment as possible. Our aim is to ensure all resources are used effectively and efficiently.  

**What's in it for you**

- Be helping to save some of our most iconic seabirds in one of the most spectacular locations in Northern Ireland and enable some ground nesting birds to breed and increase in numbers.

                            :description """Rathlin Island is one of Northern Ireland's most treasured wildlife havens, home to internationally important seabird colonies and unique native species. To help keep the island free from invasive predators like rats - which can devastate nesting birds - we are building a network of trained biosecurity volunteers. This is your chance to play a vital role in safeguarding Rathlin's natural heritage while spending time in one of the most beautiful and diverse places in the country.

**What you will be doing**

You will be starting out as a LIFE Raft volunteer and this role will then become a biosecurity volunteer. You will carry out monthly checks of one of five biosecurity loops, checking for signs of rodent activity. You'll monitor tracking tunnels, bait stations, chew blocks, and record your findings to help us respond quickly if rats are detected. **We'll provide full training** and you will be apart of occasional team days for refreshers, updates and the chance to connect with staff and other volunteers.

Depending on your availability and interests there may also be opportunities to:

- Review trail camera footage for signs of wildlife or rats
- Construct or maintain monitoring stations
- Help with equipment stock-takes and record keeping
- Support awareness, whether by chatting to friends and family or helping at public events

**Skills you'll need**

You don't need previous experience in conservation or biosecurity - just:

- A keen eye for detail and willingness to learn
- A love for nature and the outdoors
- A reasonable level of fitness (some loops involve uneven ground)
- Ability to commit to one check per month, with flexibility

We don't expect everyone to be available all the time - that's why we're building a large, flexible team to ensure coverage when it's needed most. 

**What's in it for you**

- Be part of a vital conservation effort that makes a real difference 
- Learn new skills and gain hands on experience in biosecurity monitoring
- Spend time outdoors in a stunning natural environment 
- Meet like-minded people 
- Receive full training and support 

If you are not a Rathlin resident it will be possible to carry out day trips. However, you may be required to stay on the island and accommodation will be provided in this event.""";

                            :description """We are looking for a volunteer placement assistant warden at RSPB Middleton Lakes! Our placement opportunities help people gain the skills and experience needed to start a career in conservation. You will get to meet new people and help save nature too. Assistant warden volunteer placements bring in a variety of ideas, experiences and energy into our teams, it's so much more than just getting work done; we want to hear from you if you feel like you have the motivation and passion to save nature.

The aim of our placement opportunities are to build skills and to help people gain the experience necessary to assist in taking steps towards a career, primarily in conservation. We are looking for individuals who are interested in saving nature and with the energy to learn. We are not looking for experts in conservation, or even people with lots of experience, if you are new to the sector, changing careers or looking for a new challenge, this could be for you!

**Role description:**

This role forms a vital part of the wardening team, helping to implement our reserve management plan. This will involve:

- Learning on the job about practical habitat management of wetlands, woodlands and meadows.
- Maintenance of the reserve infrastructure such as fences, paths and benches which all need regular upkeep.
- Being responsible for the visitor standards of the reserve. Making sure the reserve is looking and functioning at its best for visitors.
- Leading other volunteers on regular work party days and being responsible for the corporate work party programme.
- Helping the warden manage the grazing and livestock on site which consists of Longhorn Cattle and Konik Ponies.
- Biological surveys in the Spring/Summer including breeding bird surveys, dragonfly, butterfly, amphibian/reptile, flora, and monthly WeBS bird counts in the winter.
- Keeping the reserve ticking over by completing the day-to-day jobs such as upkeep of the workshop/store areas, maintenance of the machines and tools, responding to any issues and resolving/fixing them.
- Supporting the warden with a variety of admin jobs including updating risk assessments, emergency action plans, COSHH and other records, mapping and biological data recording, recording visitor numbers, logging volunteer work hours.
- Working occasional weekend days meeting and greeting visitors from our visitor reception.

**The skills you need:**

We are looking for an enthusiastic and friendly person who likes a challenge! Previous conservation volunteering experience isn't essential, but every day can be different on reserves like Middleton lakes, so you will need to be flexible in your approach to your work. 

You must be happy to work outside in all weathers, doing what can be challenging physical work. There will be times when you are required to work by yourself through your own initiative. A willingness to work the occasional weekend and take time off in lieu is expected. A driving license is essential.

You must be able to get to and from Middleton Lakes for the duration of your placement as we are unable to offer onsite accommodation.

The RSPB runs an inclusive volunteer placement scheme, so whether you have just graduated, finished your A Levels and looking for voluntary experience in your gap year or you are looking for a change of career path, we welcome your application. However, we do ask that you meet the following requirements:

**You must:**

- be 18 years old or over
- be available for 12 months (3 days a week)
- be IT literate
- Have a full UK driving license
- Your time:
- Minimum: 3 days a week ideally Wednesday, Thursday and Friday but  can be flexible.
- Duration: 12 months (3 days a week)
- Application closing date: 20th October 2025
- Interview date: Week commencing 27th October 2025
- Period: Starting November 12th 2025


**What's in it for you?**

This is a fantastic opportunity to work on a new and developing nature reserve, delivering aims for the benefit of wildlife and people plus developing skills that could help you towards a career in conservation.

**You will gain:**

- An insight into how a nature reserve functions and how your work fits into the overall management.
- Development of skills necessary for a job in nature conservation.
- A good understanding of wetland ecology
- Development of species identification
- Development of working with others, leadership and communication skills
- A mentor who will work with you to aid a personal development plan and organise suitable training during the internship
- Access to our internal intranet
- An opportunity to make contacts within the RSPB
- Necessary training will be provided for routine nature reserve management.
- Training on CV writing, interview techniques and job applications
- A reference on the successful completion of your placement 

Our placements are designed to offer work experience. However, completing a placement unfortunately does not guarantee future employment with the RSPB. Placements can apply for our paid vacancies but for obvious reasons a placement will need to have proven themselves in their current role before their volunteering experience will assist an application for a paid post.

**Notes:**

Please note: Clicking 'more about this role' below brings up a more generic practical reserve work role description. Also, in attachments please refer to the attachment titled assistant warden volunteer placement. 

**The deadline for applications is Sunday 14th September 2025. Interviews will be the week beginning 22nd September 2025. **

All the training necessary and background information will be provided and since you'll be giving up your time, it's only fair that we offer to re-imburse your travel expenses (up to 25 miles). The RSPB is the country's largest nature conservation charity, inspiring everyone to give nature a home.""";

Slavonian Grebes are in trouble. Once thriving on over 30 lochs in Inverness-shire, their numbers have plummeted—from 80 pairs in the 1970s to just 20 pairs on 14 lochs in 2024. With support from the Nature Restoration Fund, we’re working to uncover the causes of this decline—and we need your help.

• Digitising scanned copies of survey maps or forms by entering the data into spreadsheets or databases.

• Good communication skills

Right across the UK the RSPB manages woodlands and wetlands, heathlands and meadows. A real mosaic of different kinds of habitats for a wide range of wildlife. We want to make sure they are special places for people too. We rely on volunteers to undertake practical work that keeps the habitats in good shape and to help maintain the paths and benches and fences. It is work that never stops. We need a work party leader to ensure that our volunteer group undertakes the right work at the right time and does this safely. 

RSPB Weymouth Wetlands (Radipole Lake & Lodmoor) are very unique, wild havens for a diverse range of species – bubbles brimming with wildlife amongst the hustle and bustle of Weymouth. Home to one of the healthiest populations of Cetti’s Warblers in the country, birders near and far are drawn to its curious mix of residents and visitors, including bearded tits, marsh harriers, bitterns, sedge warblers, golden plovers, bullfinches, bar-tailed godwits, and so much more. 

It might seem like these wild places have always just been there. But quite often we have to work really hard to maintain habitats to be in the best condition for wildlife. We have lost a lot of wild landscapes, so the small places that we do have, need a bit of extra care. 

As a Work Party Leader Volunteer you will: 

- Follow an annual management plan and work with the site manager to plan work party activities.
- Ensure all the tools and equipment needed for a work party are available and in good condition. 
- Follow relevant health and safety protocols and codes of practice to ensure work is carried out safely. 
- Ensure all volunteers understand the task and how to complete it safely. 
- Welcome and induct new volunteers. 
- Be the main point of contact for volunteers throughout the work party session and give direction and support as needed. 

Full training and support will be provided but we are looking for people with skills and experience in the following areas: 

- Essential.
- Leadership skills. 
- Excellent listener and communicator. 
- Willingness to direct a team of people so that they feel fully informed, supported and included. 
- May require some diplomacy skills on occasion. 
- Good attention to detail. 
- Well organised and methodical in approach. 
- Be comfortable reading and implementing risk assessment requirements. 

Beneficial:

- Some previous experience in practical work may be beneficial, however the work party leader we are looking for acknowledges the different perspectives thoughts and ideas within the team, and encourages an open and collaborative approach to problem-solving. 

You do not need to be a wildlife or nature expert to do this role. 

If you enjoy being outdoors, then this role could be the perfect opportunity for you. This role will involve a reasonable amount of physical activity, so will enable you to keep your fitness levels high, as well as helping your mental health and wellbeing. You will be making a genuine contribution to nature conservation, and you might find it rewarding to safeguard nature in the area you are working to protect. 

We are a friendly and supportive team, so you might make new friends too. 

If you are volunteering to learn new skills and gain knowledge about wildlife conservation work, you will find that our team will be more than happy to help you on that journey. 

In this role you will be helping others to succeed, especially as you induct and train volunteers who are looking to gain skills, this can be extremely rewarding.""";

That’s why we created the Pen Pal Program , a simple yet powerful way for caring individuals like you to uplift these children with letters of hope, encouragement, and guidance. Just 20–30 minutes a week or month can make a lasting difference.

Your letters can touch on education, health, culture, the environment, or simply send warm wishes for important moments like exams, birthdays, Christmas, or Eid.

We’ll carefully match you with a child based on your availability and interests, along with their age, gender, dream job, favorite color, pets, and hobbies. Right now, more than 5,000 children are waiting to connect.

Whether you’re a student, parent, retiree, or part of a group, your words can inspire a brighter future.

Be the reason a child keeps believing. Join us today.""";

It might seem like these wild places have always just been there. But quite often we have to work really hard to maintain habitats to be in the best condition for wildlife. We have lost a lot of wild landscapes, so the small places that we do have, need a bit of extra care. 

In order to ensure that the work we are doing is having the right impact for wildlife. Our survey work helps to inform the conservation work we do. 

This is a really interesting role and will involve: 
- Surveying wildlife on the reserve.
- Input surveying data to the database or submitting it for another individual to input.
- Following the RSPB policy for lone working and holding sensitive data.  

We will offer training in ID and surveying skills to ensure that you are prepared for each individual survey. 

The skills required for this role will be dependent on what species are being monitored/surveyed. For example, bird ID skills would be required for breeding bird surveys.  

- Experience observing wildlife and a good knowledge of wildlife (or a willingness to increase your identification and/or survey knowledge to undertake this role).  
- Organisation skills, to be able to keep reliable records of what has been seen.
- IT skills for submitting records and keeping in touch. 
- Ability to work independently, or possibly in a small team. 

This is a really rewarding role and offers volunteers a chance to develop hands on experience and skills around surveying. The role also offers an opportunity to be out in nature and benefit your own health and wellbeing. It will suit someone who enjoys being outdoors and volunteers will have to observe wildlife closely, which is wonderful if you take enjoyment from the natural world. Monitoring can often take you to the same places time and again, so you will see the season changes. 

You will be contributing to Saving Nature; our survey and monitoring work helps provide vital knowledge so we are able to better protect these places for nature long into the future.""";

We believe that no one, no matter how complex their disabilities, should be isolated, left out, or unable to fulfil their potential. Our experts offer support that’s tailored to the individual needs of each person, whether that’s at our centres, through our holidays and short breaks, or in people’s own homes. In addition to practical support, we also provide information to families, and campaign for the rights of people with complex disabilities to take part in life.

Volunteers add real value to Sense, bringing their passion, enthusiasm and fresh perspectives to the work that we do. We believe that volunteers enable us to bring people together, and provide opportunities for people with complex disabilities to communicate and experience the world.

We include. We collaborate. We find a way. We challenge. We celebrate.

When: Tuesdays or Thursdays (or both) 12:30pm–16:30pm
Type: Voluntary (unpaid – expenses reimbursed if applicable)
Supervised by: Lois Donegal – Community Programme Manager
Join our friendly Greencare group, supporting adults with learning disabilities, mental health challenges, or physical disabilities to connect with nature through gardening, growing, and animal care.

Guided by eco-therapeutic principles, the group brings people together to care for plants, animals, and each other. Participants spend time outdoors, connect with nature, and build confidence and wellbeing in a relaxed, friendly environment.
Sessions take place twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), and each is facilitated by two experienced staff members. We have a large group in total of over 60 members, however most sessions we have an attendance of between 10-25 people.

Structure of the sessions:
You will arrive at 12:30 and support with set up and welcoming the group.  We start at 13:00PM with a round circle where we decide what everyone will be doing. Each session we tend to have multiple activities on offer that are adjusted to the various physical abilities in the group. For example, seated tea bag making, seated plant potting with some members of the ground fetching soil etc. and other members of the group might be weeding or doing an animal job with the support of the farm manager. 

We aim to have a volunteer and or the Community Programme Manager with each group, so everyone is supported. We do meditation at 14:45pm which Is followed by a tea/coffee break before the group feeds the animals and then we end the session. 

As a Volunteer Greencare Assistant, you’ll help set up and tidy away activities, support group members during the sessions, and bring encouragement, patience, and good humour to the day. The role can be emotionally demanding at times, so we’re looking for someone with empathy, strong boundaries, and a calm, supportive presence.
You’ll be part of a small, experienced team with staff on site at all times. No specific gardening or animal care experience is needed – just a willingness to get involved outdoors and learn as you go.
In return, you’ll gain practical experience, new skills, and the satisfaction of making a real difference in a unique, nature-based community setting.

How to Apply
If you’re interested in this voluntary opportunity, please email Lois Donegal the Community Programme Manager with a short note about why you’d like to get involved and attach your CV. You will be contacted back and asked to an informal interview at the farm and or a video call. 

Email: lois@stepneycityfarm.org 
Phone: 020 7790 8204
 
We welcome volunteers from all backgrounds and are committed to building a diverse and inclusive community.
If you have a disability or any accessibility needs, we will do our best to make adjustments so that you can take part fully in this role. Please let us know what support would help you.
