    "description": "Location:  Stepney City Farm, Stepney Way, London, E1 3DG\nWhen: Tuesdays or Thursdays (or both) 12:30pm–16:30pm\nType: Voluntary (unpaid – expenses reimbursed if applicable)\nSupervised by: Lois Donegal – Community Programme Manager\nJoin our friendly Greencare group, supporting adults with learning disabilities, mental health challenges, or physical disabilities to connect with nature through gardening, growing, and animal care.\n\nGuided by eco-therapeutic principles, the group brings people together to care for plants, animals, and each other. Participants spend time outdoors, connect with nature, and build confidence and wellbeing in a relaxed, friendly environment.\nSessions take place twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), and each is facilitated by two experienced staff members. We have a large group in total of over 60 members, however most sessions we have an attendance of between 10-25 people.\n\nStructure of the sessions:\nYou will arrive at 12:30 and support with set up and welcoming the group.  We start at 13:00PM with a round circle where we decide what everyone will be doing. Each session we tend to have multiple activities on offer that are adjusted to the various physical abilities in the group. For example, seated tea bag making, seated plant potting with some members of the ground fetching soil etc. and other members of the group might be weeding or doing an animal job with the support of the farm manager. \n\nWe aim to have a volunteer and or the Community Programme Manager with each group, so everyone is supported. We do meditation at 14:45pm which Is followed by a tea/coffee break before the group feeds the animals and then we end the session. \n\nAs a Volunteer Greencare Assistant, you’ll help set up and tidy away activities, support group members during the sessions, and bring encouragement, patience, and good humour to the day. The role can be emotionally demanding at times, so we’re looking for someone with empathy, strong boundaries, and a calm, supportive presence.\nYou’ll be part of a small, experienced team with staff on site at all times. No specific gardening or animal care experience is needed – just a willingness to get involved outdoors and learn as you go.\nIn return, you’ll gain practical experience, new skills, and the satisfaction of making a real difference in a unique, nature-based community setting.\n\nHow to Apply\nIf you’re interested in this voluntary opportunity, please email Lois Donegal the Community Programme Manager with a short note about why you’d like to get involved and attach your CV. You will be contacted back and asked to an informal interview at the farm and or a video call. \n\nEmail: lois@stepneycityfarm.org \nPhone: 020 7790 8204\n \nWe welcome volunteers from all backgrounds and are committed to building a diverse and inclusive community.\nIf you have a disability or any accessibility needs, we will do our best to make adjustments so that you can take part fully in this role. Please let us know what support would help you.\n\n",

Telephone and virtual support can suit full time work as well as company volunteering opportunities. It is flexible and can fit in around your other regular commitments allowing you the chance to get involved and give back to your community at a time that suits you and the family you are supporting.\nWeekly telephone or virtual support has become a key element of our support offer. Our telephone and virtual support volunteers are ensuring we are reaching families who feel more comfortable sharing their struggles through a call rather than face to face.",

    "description": "Sense Virtual Buddying volunteers make a real difference to supporting young people and adults who may be lonely or isolated.\n\nSense matches volunteers with disabled people to meet for an hour a week on Zoom, over phone, by email, text or letter writing. Our volunteers have spent thousands of hours with their buddies — learning new skills, having fun, and forming fantastic friendships. Sense matches each volunteer with someone who has similar interests, to make sure you have a great time. You and your buddy choose a time that suits you, and you can decide what activities you’d like to do together.\n\nThe Role of a Virtual Buddy\n\nSense matches each volunteer with someone who has similar interests to ensure you’ll have lots of fun together. Once matched with a buddy, you will get to know each other remotely via video calls, phone calls, texting, emails or through letters.\n\nYou’ll arrange weekly sessions and plan fun things to do together – what this looks like will be inspired by your mutual interests. You could be gaming, doing arts and crafts, playing music, seed planting – there are so many possibilities! We will provide you with weekly themed activities to help to support you in planning your interactions with your buddy.\n\nWe’ll also keep in touch with you to ensure you have all the support you need.\n\nThe programme is open to all volunteers who are 16 and over. You don't need to have previous experience volunteering or caring for disabled people. We welcome people from all backgrounds and with all interests.\n\nWhat we can Offer You\n\nBefore you start your volunteering role, we’ll make sure that you’ve had the training you need to feel confident. This will be delivered online and via video call.\n\nWhile you’re volunteering with us as a Virtual Buddy, you’ll get:\n\nA written account of your volunteering and references if required\nReimbursement of pre-agreed expenses (up to £25)\nVolunteering as a Sense Virtual Buddy is a great opportunity to develop new skills and get to know new people whilst making a real difference to a person’s life. \n\nWho we are Looking For\n\nWe need positive, empathetic volunteers who are passionate about supporting people with complex disabilities to communicate and experience the world. We are looking for volunteers who are great communicators and who are friendly, enthusiastic, positive and ready to have fun!\n\nWe’re also always looking for volunteers who have knowledge or experience of British Sign Language (BSL) and/or other communication methods like Makaton.\n\nAbout Sense\n\nFor everyone living with complex disabilities. For everyone who is deafblind. Sense is here to offer personalised support to help people communicate and experience the world. We believe that no one, no matter how complex their disabilities, should be isolated, left out, or unable to fulfil their potential. Our experts offer support that’s tailored to the individual needs of each person, whether that’s at our centres, through our holidays and short breaks, or in people’s own homes. In addition to practical support, we also provide information to families, and campaign for the rights of people with complex disabilities to take part in life.\n\nVolunteers add real value to Sense, bringing their passion, enthusiasm and fresh perspectives to the work that we do. We believe that volunteers enable us to bring people together, and provide opportunities for people with complex disabilities to communicate and experience the world.\n\nWe include. We collaborate. We find a way. We challenge. We celebrate.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding the role or would like some more information please contact the volunteering team at volunteer@sense.org.uk\n\nWe’d love for you to consider joining us as a Sense Virtual Buddy!",

We plan to do this in a number of ways. These will include Awareness Training facilitated by Survivors for the organisations helping and supporting Survivors at the time of them considering reporting their experiences, as well as providing 1:1 Peer Survivor Support and supporting National Petitions.\nThe Campaign is very much in its early days - we have just created our social media accounts and website. The Campaign Founder; award-winning mental health UK Blogger with over 1.3 million readers and sexual abuse and rape Survivor; Aimee Wilson, is currently working on our Campaign Strategy and various organisational documents to then begin collaborations and securing endorsements with her already established connections with the Chief Executive in the NHS and the Mental Health Lead of the Police. \nWe will then be looking to hire Volunteers in various positions. \nOur social media accounts are @shakemyhandUK on both Twitter (X) and Instagram as well as our page on Facebook (Shake My Hand Campaign) and our website is set to launch June 17th.

    "description": "Across the UK, our 270 local groups play a vital part in supporting people affected by MS. They provide sense of belonging, unity and friendship. And they deliver services and support for their local MS community.\n\nWe are looking to recruit a Support Volunteer for the Lambeth and Southwark Group. As our local group Support Volunteer you’ll help people affected by MS find information about local and national services. That could be helping someone access local information about the care or benefits they need or giving them a hand with a grant application. See a video about one of our Support Volunteers here.\n\nIn this role you’ll be able to develop your listening and communication skills, as well as your knowledge of local services. Most importantly you’ll help people affected by MS to access the help they need.\n\nTime commitment\n\nWe estimate this role will need around 2 hours a week. Our roles are flexible and aim to fit around you. Time commitments for this role may vary depending on your activities. This is an ongoing role.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to gain experience within a large charity and develop your existing skills and learn new ones. We need you to get involved and help make positive changes to the lives of people affected by MS.\n\nAbout you\n\nYou’ll have an interest in the MS Society and the work that we do, as well as the enthusiasm to represent both us and our values locally. You will understand the needs of people affected by MS in your area and be sympathetic to the needs and motivations of volunteers. You’ll be confident using Microsoft Office, the internet and email. You’ll be able to apply disability, equality and inclusion practices and understand and apply our risk management system. Ideally you’ll understand the local area and organisations that provide local services.\n\nYou will be reliable and easy to contact and you need to live in or near the local area the group to carry out this role.\n\nApply \n\n1. Read through the role description carefully\n\n2. Please apply online\n\nThe MS Society is committed to promoting diversity. We can only offer roles to over 18s.",

    "description": "Support the work of St John Ambulance in your community by volunteering as a Community Volunteer, an exciting new role which is designed to revamp how volunteering looks in the modern world; flexible, innovative and is open for all.\n\nWe need people who have a passion for helping others, care about their communities and want to make a difference, supporting them to become safe and more resilient. Community Volunteers can choose from a wide selection of activities – including fundraising, talks and demonstrations, supporting at events, volunteer welfare, social media and administration support.\n\nThrough supporting the growth of community partnerships, you will bring people along to our cause, growing our membership and fundraising base and spreading the message that First Aid Saves Lives.\n\nGive as much (or little) time as you can afford. With this new role, you simply volunteer when it works for you. That means you can give as much time as you like or as little as 24 hours across a whole year, whenever it suits you. It’s perfect for busy lives, changing schedules, or for anyone seeking a low-commitment involvement. \n\nThe Community Volunteer provides an easy way to stay connected and contribute meaningfully to your local community. Here are some examples of what you could do: \n\nCommunity fundraising\nTalks and demonstrations\nSupport at events\nVolunteer welfare\nCommunity Roadshows\nSupporting national campaigns\nCounting and banking money\nBooking events\nSupporting Networks  \nAdministration support\nWriting thank you and community letters\nMedia and social media\nCommunity news and Network newsletters \nThrough volunteering as a Community Volunteer, you’ll get a huge sense of satisfaction and pride delivering an essential service. It’s great for you, great for your community and great for our nation, and it requires only a small commitment of your time.\n\nOnce we have completed your selection and screening for this role, we will provide you with an induction, as well as invite you to any necessary training sessions. We will also provide you with a supportive environment while you are volunteering with us. Information about our volunteer roles are included in the role descriptions. What you can expect from SJA, and what we expect from those who volunteer with us, is included in the volunteer charter.\n\nNorth Devon & Torridge area, based primarily out of Barnstaple but welcome from any town in the area.\n\n\nOrdinarily, our Community Volunteers meet once per fortnight to develop skills, build friendships, and make a different to our communities. We would ask that you try to attend as often as possible, but you don't have to attend every session and we are happy to be as flexible as you need.\n\n\nOnce you've applied, we will be in touch to invite you to an informal interview as soon as possible. Here, you can meet the team, ask us any questions and decide if this is the right opportunity for you.\n \n\nClosing date for these opportunities is: 17/11/2025\n\nIf you’d like to know more about volunteering or would just like to chat to someone who does, get in touch. Please contact our hiring manager, George Stacey, via emailing: george.stacey@sja.org.uk\n\nTo apply for this opportunity please follow the link below:",

This role does involve a reasonable amount of physical activity, so will enable you to keep your fitness levels high, as well as helping your mental health and wellbeing. You will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are making a genuine contribution to nature conservation, and you might find it rewarding to safeguard nature in the area you are working to protect. \r\n\r\nWe are a friendly and supportive team. If you are volunteering to learn new skills and gain knowledge about wildlife conservation work, you will find that our team will be more than happy to help you on that journey.",

    "description": "Did you know that there are RSPB Youth Groups across the UK, and our network is growing and expanding, so we need more inspirational Assistant Leaders to join our team!\r\n\r\nYou could be the person we need to join this adventure and help support young people in your area to learn about, explore and help the wildlife around them in a fun and engaging way.\r\n\r\n**Why we love our youth groups!**\r\n\r\nWe know that if young people learn to love wildlife and nature they will want to protect it and be empowered to take meaningful action to defend it in their own communities.\r\n\r\nYou could be part of a team of like-minded, enthusiastic people who love nature and want our younger generations to experience that sense of awe when encountering the natural world and share the excitement of being part of a bigger movement to save nature.\r\n\r\n**What do you need to know?**\r\n\r\n- You’ll join a leadership team to run the group sessions and could help with a variety of tasks including programme planning, promotions, finance or admin tasks depending on what best suits your skillset. \r\n- You need to enjoy working with young people –they are the heart of what we do\r\n- You will be asked to complete a variety of training including induction and safeguarding and there are optional opportunities for further development in other areas such as Equality and Diversity\r\n- We will ask you to commit to attend at least six sessions per year. The groups usually meet monthly so with preparation time you will need to give around 4-6 hours per month.\r\n\r\nWhy not get in touch and see how you would fit into this role?\r\n\r\nDon’t just take our word for it! This is what one of our new volunteers says:\r\n\r\n“The prospect of working as an Assistant Youth Leader, alongside professionals, who are equally passionate about conservation is both inspiring and motivating. I am eager to immerse myself in the team's projects and contribute to the invaluable work that the RSPB is known for. Furthermore, I believe that being a part of the RSPB is not just a \r\nshort-term opportunity, but a steppingstone towards a long and fulfilling journey in my career. I look forward to working with the children, learning from my colleagues, and making a positive impact on the environment we all care deeply about.”\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: if you are a member of RSPB staff please contact YGsupport@rspb.org.uk before applying.",

    "description": "The RSPB manages a big network of nature reserves which are havens for wildlife, and importantly very special places for people of all ages and abilities to visit and experience a nature rich landscape.  \r\n\r\nNature is in trouble, there aren't many places left where wildlife can thrive, that is why we want to welcome more people to these places. \r\n\r\nWe are looking for volunteers who can help with all our visitor engagement activities but primarily welcoming visitors to the reserve at our visitor centre during the weekend and bank holidays throughout the year. There may be opportunities to help at events and other activities happening as well. \r\n\r\nAs a Visitor Engagement Volunteer the tasks you will undertake will depend on which reserve you're working on, but will include some of the following: \r\n\r\n- Providing a friendly welcome to visitors when they arrive. \r\n- Having conversations with visitors and finding out how you can help them enjoy their visit. \r\n- Talking to the public about the work of the RSPB, what we're all about including work happening on the Reserve. \r\n- Ensuring the welcome area is clean and tidy, leaflets are replenished, and information boards are up to date.\r\n\r\nFull training and support will be provide for this role but you do need to be a ‘people person’ and have good communication skills. In order to provide as much cover at the visitor centre as we can there is potential for an element of lone working. Lone working will only happen if you are happy to do this - don't let this put you off. Full training and support will be given. \r\n\r\nThis is a really rewarding and enjoyable role. You will be working with a friendly team on a beautiful nature reserve, you will have the opportunity to make new friends and spend time outdoors. You will get to meet loads of new people in this role, enjoying conversation and helping people have a wonderful visit. \r\n\r\nThere is always the opportunity to learn new things and gain skills through volunteering, by working on a reserve, you'll naturally learn all about how nature reserves are managed and the wildlife that is found there.",

    "description": "Our nature reserves are special places for people and wildlife. We need volunteers to complete a variety of surveys to collect essential data. This science will contribute to habitat management, inform policy and help influence external organisations. \r\n\r\nIt might seem like these wild places have always just been there. But quite often we have to work really hard to maintain habitats to be in the best condition for wildlife. We have lost a lot of wild landscapes, so the small places that we do have, need a bit of extra care. \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that the work we are doing is having the right impact for wildlife. Our survey work helps to inform the conservation work we do. \r\n\r\nThis is a really interesting role and will involve: \r\n- Surveying wildlife on the reserve.\r\n- Input surveying data to the database or submitting it for another individual to input.\r\n- Following the RSPB policy for lone working and holding sensitive data.  \r\n\r\nWe will offer training in ID and surveying skills to ensure that you are prepared for each individual survey. \r\n\r\nThe skills required for this role will be dependent on what species are being monitored/surveyed. For example, bird ID skills would be required for breeding bird surveys.  \r\n\r\n- Experience observing wildlife and a good knowledge of wildlife (or a willingness to increase your identification and/or survey knowledge to undertake this role).  \r\n- Organisation skills, to be able to keep reliable records of what has been seen.\r\n- IT skills for submitting records and keeping in touch. \r\n- Ability to work independently, or possibly in a small team. \r\n\r\nThis is a really rewarding role and offers volunteers a chance to develop hands on experience and skills around surveying. The role also offers an opportunity to be out in nature and benefit your own health and wellbeing. It will suit someone who enjoys being outdoors and volunteers will have to observe wildlife closely, which is wonderful if you take enjoyment from the natural world. Monitoring can often take you to the same places time and again, so you will see the season changes. \r\n\r\nYou will be contributing to Saving Nature; our survey and monitoring work helps provide vital knowledge so we are able to better protect these places for nature long into the future.",

You will be a central part of our ambitious reserve team, helping us deliver our species targets while providing a wonderful visitor experience.\r\n\r\n**What’s in it for you**\r\nFrampton Marsh and Freiston Shore are at the forefront of innovative habitat and visitor management techniques. You will get the chance to be part of developing these processes and influence how we view reserve management for years to come, both for wildlife and visitors. We are offering you the chance to learn and develop your skills on managing wetlands, maintaining infrastructure, conducting research, survey and monitoring. Our team are all very keen to help you start your career in conservation and so far we have a high success rate of our residential volunteers finding paid employment. The accommodation provided is a large Georgian Grade II listed farmhouse  which is a one minute walk from the Frampton reserve boundary. \r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\nYou will be able to work both as part of a team and undertake tasks yourself. You should have a keen interest in conservation, good interpersonal skills, a desire to learn and develop your identification skills of birds and other wetland wildlife.

We are looking for volunteers to stay at one of our residential reserves for between 4 weeks to 1 year, which means our residential volunteers provide support that is integral.\r\n\r\nThe RSPB is the UK's largest nature conservation charity! Join our fantastic volunteers who are helping to inspire everyone to give nature a home and secure a healthy environment for wildlife. We will help you gain skills and give you an invaluable insight into our essential work.\r\n\r\n**What you will be doing**\r\n• Tasks vary greatly depending on which reserve you volunteer for, but it will be vital work and is likely to include some of the following:\r\n• Practical conservation/management tasks.\r\n• Undertaking wildlife monitoring and surveying.\r\n• Reserve checks and general reserve maintenance.\r\n• Visitor operations e.g. welcoming visitors and directing them to points of interest.\r\n• Running or helping out at public events.\r\n\r\n**The skills you need**\r\n• We will provide all the training and information needed to carry out the role.

    "description": "Did you know that there are RSPB Youth Groups throughout the UK? Our network is growing and expanding, so we need more volunteers to lead and shape our youth group teams. \r\n\r\nYou could be the person we need to join this adventure and help support young people in your area to learn about, explore and help the wildlife around them in a fun and engaging way.\r\n\r\n**Why we love our youth groups!**\r\n\r\nWe know that if young people learn to love wildlife and nature, they will want to protect it and be empowered to take meaningful action to defend it in their own communities.\r\n\r\nYou could be part of a team of like-minded, enthusiastic people who love nature and want our younger generations to experience that sense of awe when encountering something new or the excitement of being part of a bigger movement to save nature.\r\n\r\n**What do you need to know?**\r\n\r\n- You will use your existing skills to lead and motivate a team of dedicated volunteers, delegating tasks by getting to know everyone’s strengths and experiences.\r\n- You will be the main link with the RSPB youth team and be responsible for sharing information to the youth group. The RSPB Youth Team will support you to ensure the group is using our framework and operating within our standards.\r\n- You will need to be confident with using a computer for example to communicate using email to send us required documentation.\r\n- With your team you will plan the programme and run the sessions in a safe and fun way. The programme will be made up of activities where young people can experience and take meaningful action to protect nature.\r\n- You will ensure that the group’s finances are managed in accordance with our policies and submit annual financial returns.\r\n- You will liaise with reserves, local groups and other wildlife organisations.\r\n- You will invite regular feedback from your group leaders, and most importantly the young people to evaluate the success of your meetings and work out what needs to be done to be even better.\r\n- You need to enjoy working with young people –they are the heart of what we do.\r\n- You will be asked to complete a variety of training including induction and safeguarding and data protection.\r\n- The youth groups usually meet monthly, and Main Leaders usually spend six to eight hours per month outside of the meetings on the role depending on how the responsibilities are shared within the team.\r\n\r\n**Why not get in touch and see how you would fit into this role?**\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: if you are a member of RSPB staff please contact YGsupport@rspb.org.uk before applying.",

We are looking for people who can take on a regular shift walking the reserve,  keeping an eye out for maintenance issues while engaging with visitors in a positive and friendly manner. \r\n\r\nThis role will include all of the following:\r\n- Talking to members of the public about the reserve and the wildlife they might see.\r\n- Supporting our 'Plovers in Peril' campaign to highlight the importance of shoreline habitats for beach nesting birds\r\n- Checking paths, hides, benches and reporting issues back to the wider team. \r\n- Litter picking and sweeping hides\r\n- Checking the car park machine and reporting issues back to the wider team\r\n- Reporting inappropriate visitor behaviour. \r\n- Checking permits for special access parking area \r\n- Reporting visitor footfall \r\n- Supporting the wider team on high visitors days eg wader spectacles (dates and times for these will vary) by helping with parking, visitor flow and visitor engagement\r\n- Where possible, this role is undertaken in buddy pairs\r\n\r\nTraining and support will be provided but for this role the following are essential: \r\n\r\n- Physically fit and able to be on your feet for 2-4 hours. \r\n- Good 'people skills', including diplomacy  \r\n- Problem solving skills \r\n- Ability to work independently and as part of a team\r\n- Good wildlife ID skills are advantageous but not essential\r\n\r\nThis is a really rewarding role set in a beautiful wildlife rich setting. The great outdoors will be your place of work and you will be able to take it at your own pace. By talking to visitors as you go along, you'll have the pleasure of helping people learn more about the reserve and the work of the RSPB, or just be a familiar friendly face to our regulars.  \r\n\r\nYou will be making a genuine contribution to nature conservation, and you might find it rewarding to safeguard nature in the area you are working to protect. You may be working alone in a remote setting or paired with another volunteer depending on our team capacity.\r\n\r\nOur nature reserves are very special places for people and wildlife. Right across the UK the RSPB manages woodlands and wetlands, heathlands and meadows. A real mosaic of different kinds of habitats for a wide range of wildlife.",

    "title": "Practical Reserve Work (Assistant Warden Volunteer Placement)",
    "description": "We are looking for a volunteer placement assistant warden at RSPB Middleton Lakes! Our placement opportunities help people gain the skills and experience needed to start a career in conservation. You will get to meet new people and help save nature too. Assistant warden volunteer placements bring in a variety of ideas, experiences and energy into our teams, it's so much more than just getting work done; we want to hear from you if you feel like you have the motivation and passion to save nature.\r\n\r\nThe aim of our placement opportunities are to build skills and to help people gain the experience necessary to assist in taking steps towards a career, primarily in conservation. We are looking for individuals who are interested in saving nature and with the energy to learn. We are not looking for experts in conservation, or even people with lots of experience, if you are new to the sector, changing careers or looking for a new challenge, this could be for you!\r\n\r\n**Role description:**\r\n\r\nThis role forms a vital part of the wardening team, helping to implement our reserve management plan. This will involve:\r\n\r\n- Learning on the job about practical habitat management of wetlands, woodlands and meadows.\r\n- Maintenance of the reserve infrastructure such as fences, paths and benches which all need regular upkeep.\r\n- Being responsible for the visitor standards of the reserve. Making sure the reserve is looking and functioning at its best for visitors.\r\n- Leading other volunteers on regular work party days and being responsible for the corporate work party programme.\r\n- Helping the warden manage the grazing and livestock on site which consists of Longhorn Cattle and Konik Ponies.\r\n- Biological surveys in the Spring/Summer including breeding bird surveys, dragonfly, butterfly, amphibian/reptile, flora, and monthly WeBS bird counts in the winter.\r\n- Keeping the reserve ticking over by completing the day-to-day jobs such as upkeep of the workshop/store areas, maintenance of the machines and tools, responding to any issues and resolving/fixing them.\r\n- Supporting the warden with a variety of admin jobs including updating risk assessments, emergency action plans, COSHH and other records, mapping and biological data recording, recording visitor numbers, logging volunteer work hours.\r\n- Working occasional weekend days meeting and greeting visitors from our visitor reception.\r\n\r\n**The skills you need:**\r\n\r\nWe are looking for an enthusiastic and friendly person who likes a challenge! Previous conservation volunteering experience isn't essential, but every day can be different on reserves like Middleton lakes, so you will need to be flexible in your approach to your work. \r\n\r\nYou must be happy to work outside in all weathers, doing what can be challenging physical work. There will be times when you are required to work by yourself through your own initiative. A willingness to work the occasional weekend and take time off in lieu is expected. A driving license is essential.\r\n\r\nYou must be able to get to and from Middleton Lakes for the duration of your placement as we are unable to offer onsite accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe RSPB runs an inclusive volunteer placement scheme, so whether you have just graduated, finished your A Levels and looking for voluntary experience in your gap year or you are looking for a change of career path, we welcome your application. However, we do ask that you meet the following requirements:\r\n\r\n**You must:**\r\n\r\n- be 18 years old or over\r\n- be available for 12 months (3 days a week)\r\n- be IT literate\r\n- Have a full UK driving license\r\n- Your time:\r\n- Minimum: 3 days a week ideally Wednesday, Thursday and Friday but  can be flexible.\r\n- Duration: 12 months (3 days a week)\r\n- Application closing date: 20th October 2025\r\n- Interview date: Week commencing 27th October 2025\r\n- Period: Starting November 12th 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n**What's in it for you?**\r\n\r\nThis is a fantastic opportunity to work on a new and developing nature reserve, delivering aims for the benefit of wildlife and people plus developing skills that could help you towards a career in conservation.\r\n\r\n**You will gain:**\r\n\r\n- An insight into how a nature reserve functions and how your work fits into the overall management.\r\n- Development of skills necessary for a job in nature conservation.\r\n- A good understanding of wetland ecology\r\n- Development of species identification\r\n- Development of working with others, leadership and communication skills\r\n- A mentor who will work with you to aid a personal development plan and organise suitable training during the internship\r\n- Access to our internal intranet\r\n- An opportunity to make contacts within the RSPB\r\n- Necessary training will be provided for routine nature reserve management.\r\n- Training on CV writing, interview techniques and job applications\r\n- A reference on the successful completion of your placement \r\n\r\nOur placements are designed to offer work experience. However, completing a placement unfortunately does not guarantee future employment with the RSPB. Placements can apply for our paid vacancies but for obvious reasons a placement will need to have proven themselves in their current role before their volunteering experience will assist an application for a paid post.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\nPlease note: Clicking 'more about this role' below brings up a more generic practical reserve work role description. Also, in attachments please refer to the attachment titled assistant warden volunteer placement. \r\n\r\n**The deadline for applications is Sunday 14th September 2025. Interviews will be the week beginning 22nd September 2025. **\r\n\r\nAll the training necessary and background information will be provided and since you'll be giving up your time, it's only fair that we offer to re-imburse your travel expenses (up to 25 miles). The RSPB is the country's largest nature conservation charity, inspiring everyone to give nature a home.",

      "description": "At We Are Explorers, we create radically inclusive, joyful spaces for LGBTQ+ people — with a proud focus on Neurodivergent people. Because while 3.8% of the UK population identifies as LGBTQ+, a huge 25% of Neurodivergent people do. So why are so many queer spaces still inaccessible, overwhelming, or just not built with us in mind?\n\nWe exist to change that.\n\nWe were founded by Neurodivergent genderqueer person Jam Hirata-Smith (any pronouns) in 2021, while they were recovering from psychosis and navigating the often-overlooked gap for queer Neurodivergent spaces. What started as a youth group with just a handful of young people quickly snowballed into an organisation that now serves Neurodivergent LGBTQ+ adults and young people alike. Along the way, we also work to train schools, organisations, and individuals on the intersections of Neurodivergence and queerness.\n\nMainstream LGBTQ+ scenes can feel chaotic, loud, and exclusive. Neurodivergent spaces often overlook queer identities. We're building bridges between these worlds — and centering the people too often left out of both.\n\nAutistic and otherwise Neurodivergent people experience gender and sexuality differently, and that truth deserves space, voice, and pride.\n\nWe believe:\n\nBeing fully yourself shouldn't come at the cost of burnout, masking, or erasure.\n\nInclusion means designing spaces that start with Neurodivergent needs — because when you do that, everyone benefits.\n\nQueerness and Neurodivergence are not just valid — they’re vibrant, intertwined, and deserving of celebration.\n\nWe’re not here just to help people “survive” — we’re here to help people thrive.\nWe’re here to create spaces where softness is strength, stim toys are welcome, and identity is never a debate.",
      "purpose": "We support Neurodivergent LGBTQ+ individuals by providing inclusive groups, services, advocacy, and training to improve accessibility, wellbeing, and empowerment. Our values are to be safe, engaging, and person-led.",

    "description": "In many African communities, poverty and tradition force children into adult roles far too soon, becoming parents, spouses, or laborers as early as age 12. Education is often cut short, and support is limited.\n\nThat’s why we created the Pen Pal Program , a simple yet powerful way for caring individuals like you to uplift these children with letters of hope, encouragement, and guidance. Just 20–30 minutes a week or month can make a lasting difference.\n\nYour letters can touch on education, health, culture, the environment, or simply send warm wishes for important moments like exams, birthdays, Christmas, or Eid.\n\nWe’ll carefully match you with a child based on your availability and interests, along with their age, gender, dream job, favorite color, pets, and hobbies. Right now, more than 5,000 children are waiting to connect.\n\nWhether you’re a student, parent, retiree, or part of a group, your words can inspire a brighter future.\n\nBe the reason a child keeps believing. Join us today.",

      "description": "Launched in 2016 by a committed group of people determined to deliver locally owned community energy. Award-winning Grimsby Community Energy is a community benefit society (CBS), a form of not-for-profit cooperative owned and run by local people that works for the benefit of the community.\n\nOver the last eight years we have raised over £894,000 of investment to deliver renewable energy across Grimsby, Cleethorpes and North East Lincolnshire, installing 697kW of solar PV (photovoltaic) panels for community organisations, generating 1.14GWh of clean electricity and saving 279t of CO2.\n\nThis place-based approach to energy generation means local community organisations pay less for their energy and everyone who invests in Grimsby Community Energy has a vote in the running of our society. We are proud to have kept our promises to our investors and our community, ensuring we pay members a fair rate of return and creating wider community benefits, including creating jobs and establishing a community fund.\n\nOur team have worked hard to develop our business but there is so much more we can do with your support. We appreciate grant funding from Co-operatives UK Booster Fund, NELC’s UK Shared Prosperity Fund, and the REACH Fund.\n\nOur vision is to reach one megawatt of community owned solar PV by the end of 2025, and we won’t stop there, adding a second megawatt by 2030. So far, we have identified three new sites and one existing site, with more in the pipeline, that could join our solar community with your help.",

Our Visitor Centre is the Welcome hub for all our visitors. We are looking for volunteers to help in the centre, from welcoming people on arrival, explaining the various trails and what's about to see. \r\nYou will need to be a people person, happy chatting and engaging with visitors of all ages and backgrounds ensuring that they have a warm wonderful experience at Ynys-hir. You will be expected to take transactions and contribute to the daily cleanliness of the centre, display and stock. \r\n\r\nFull training and support will be provide for this role but you do need to be a ‘people person’ and have good communication skills.\r\n\r\nThis is a really rewarding and enjoyable role. You will be working with a friendly team on a beautiful nature reserve, you will have the opportunity to make new friends and spend time outdoors. You will get to meet loads of new people in this role, enjoying conversation and helping people have a wonderful visit.\r\n\r\nThere is always the opportunity to learn new things and gain skills through volunteering, by working on a reserve, you'll naturally learn all about how nature reserves are managed and the wildlife that is found there.\r\n\r\nThis role is not suitable for under 18’s.",

    "description": "Do you want to be inspired by the impact of education?\n\nWhat will you be doing?\nGoverning bodies are responsible for the strategic management of a school and will make decisions about a wide range of issues.\n\nThe core responsibilities involved are:\n•\tEnsuring accountability\n•\tProviding support and challenge to the schools senior leadership team\n•\tMonitoring and evaluating the school’s progress\n•\tBudgetary allocation and control\n•\tShaping plans for school improvement and overseeing their implementation\n•\tSetting the school’s aims and values\n•\tAppointing senior members of staff including the Head Teacher\nThe governing body is usually split in to a small number of committees, each responsible for one area such as finance or pupil achievement. These committees will meet separately from the main governing body to discuss relevant issues in more detail. Discussion is then fed back at a full governing body meeting.\nA school governing body is made up of representatives from the school, the parents, the local authority and the local community.\n\nWhat difference will you make?\nGovernors make decisions that affect schools for years to come. Our recent impact survey found that our volunteers bring £9.9 million worth of value to schools each year, and 9/10 volunteers would recommend being a governor to a friend. \nAs a governor, you can visit the school to gain an understanding of the culture and ethos and to get the most out of the role. You’ll also have the opportunity to meet children, parents, and teachers, and see the impact of your work first-hand.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\nVolunteering as a school governor is a challenging but rewarding role. As part of the governing board, you’ll:\n•\thelp schools overcome challenges to ensure a bright future for children in your community\n•\twork collaboratively with people from different backgrounds, challenging your own perspective and broadening your network\n•\tgain experience outside of your job description and skills you can bring back to work",

This role does involve a reasonable amount of physical activity, so will enable you to keep your fitness levels high, as well as helping your mental health and wellbeing. You will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are making a genuine contribution to nature conservation, and you might find it rewarding to safeguard nature in the area you are working to protect. \r\n\r\nWe are a friendly and supportive team.

    "description": "Volunteers are the heart and soul of our shop and are essential in helping visitors to get everything they want from their time with us. We want our visitors to be welcomed with a warm smile and a friendly hello, in a well-kept, clean and full shop. By giving your time to this role you’ll be making a huge difference to the wildlife and habitat here at Fairburn Ings, as all our profits go straight back to helping nature. \r\n\r\nThere's lots to keep you busy, so you’ll never be bored, here are some of the things you’ll be doing:\r\n- Delivering excellent customer service, using the till and having a great knowledge of all our products so you can help each customer pick the right products. We will give you lots of training, but you need to be a real ‘people person’, chatty and friendly, approachable and with real enthusiasm for what we do.\r\n- We have annual targets each year for our shop sales, so you’ll help us reach those targets. We also get mystery shoppers, so it’s important that you know the expected standards, to make sure we pass with flying colours!!\r\n- We have lots of great events planned to let our visitors know about – each conversation is different so you can tailor each one and mention the things you think are relevant to that person.\r\n- There is a small café as part of our shop, so we have plenty of checks to do each day to make sure we keep to our food hygiene standards.\r\n- You’ll help us around opening and closing routines, with regular stocktaking, deliveries most days and there are various events you can get involved with too if you wish.\r\n- You will talk to people about how they can support the RSPB and if you are interested, can even learn how to make new members for the RSPB, helping us gain more support and allowing us to do even more for nature.\r\n\r\nThis role is very rewarding. You get to meet lots of people, make new friends, and to top it all off you are working on a gorgeous nature reserve – what could be better? We need you and your enthusiasm to help our customers get the absolute best from their visit, if this sounds like you then get in touch now.\r\n\r\nYou can claim your travel expenses when volunteering, and you will be provided with a uniform and all the resources and training you need to undertake your role. You will have opportunities to learn new things and gain new skills and to learn about our reserves and the wildlife that is found here. You will need to undertake some essential online training, either at home or on site and you will be supported by a line manager and have lots of opportunity to discuss your role with them. \r\n\r\n**We also welcome applications from young people who are under 18 and wanting to gain volunteering experience. This is a great thing to add to your CV. Giving your time for something you believe in is a good thing to do, and makes you stand out against others when applying for jobs.**\r\n\r\nThis is an essential role to support the running of our shop, and therefore we do have fixed shifts to ensure we are able to operate as planned. These are: : \r\nFull day 9am to 4.30pm in winter and 5.30pm in summer,\r\nMorning 9am to 1.00pm, \r\nAfternoon 1.00pm to 4.30pm in winter and 5.30pm in summer, \r\nLunch cover 11.30am to 2.30pm. \r\n(full or half day shifts are available, we particularly need volunteers for Friday and Sunday afternoons)\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this description of the role. Clicking on ‘more about this role’ will take you to the generic ‘role profile’ for this opportunity. A role profile is the family to which an opportunity belongs and informs the vetting and training requirements. We particularly recommend taking note of the disclaimer.",

    "description": "RSPB reserves are special places for people and wildlife. We need volunteers to help keep the habitats, paths, benches and fences in good shape. This rewarding role offers the chance to meet new people and make a positive impact for nature. \r\n\r\nRight across the UK the RSPB manages woodlands and wetlands, heathlands and meadows. A real mosaic of different kinds of habitats for a wide range of wildlife. We want to make sure they are special places for people too. We rely on volunteers to undertake practical work that keeps the habitats in good shape and to help maintain the paths and benches and fences. It is work that never stops. We need a work party leader to ensure that our volunteer group undertakes the right work at the right time and does this safely. \r\n\r\nRSPB Weymouth Wetlands (Radipole Lake & Lodmoor) are very unique, wild havens for a diverse range of species – bubbles brimming with wildlife amongst the hustle and bustle of Weymouth. Home to one of the healthiest populations of Cetti’s Warblers in the country, birders near and far are drawn to its curious mix of residents and visitors, including bearded tits, marsh harriers, bitterns, sedge warblers, golden plovers, bullfinches, bar-tailed godwits, and so much more. \r\n\r\nIt might seem like these wild places have always just been there. But quite often we have to work really hard to maintain habitats to be in the best condition for wildlife. We have lost a lot of wild landscapes, so the small places that we do have, need a bit of extra care. \r\n\r\nAs a Work Party Leader Volunteer you will: \r\n\r\n- Follow an annual management plan and work with the site manager to plan work party activities.\r\n- Ensure all the tools and equipment needed for a work party are available and in good condition. \r\n- Follow relevant health and safety protocols and codes of practice to ensure work is carried out safely. \r\n- Ensure all volunteers understand the task and how to complete it safely. \r\n- Welcome and induct new volunteers. \r\n- Be the main point of contact for volunteers throughout the work party session and give direction and support as needed. \r\n\r\nFull training and support will be provided but we are looking for people with skills and experience in the following areas: \r\n\r\n- Essential.\r\n- Leadership skills. \r\n- Excellent listener and communicator. \r\n- Willingness to direct a team of people so that they feel fully informed, supported and included. \r\n- May require some diplomacy skills on occasion. \r\n- Good attention to detail. \r\n- Well organised and methodical in approach. \r\n- Be comfortable reading and implementing risk assessment requirements. \r\n\r\nBeneficial:\r\n\r\n- Some previous experience in practical work may be beneficial, however the work party leader we are looking for acknowledges the different perspectives thoughts and ideas within the team, and encourages an open and collaborative approach to problem-solving. \r\n\r\nYou do not need to be a wildlife or nature expert to do this role. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy being outdoors, then this role could be the perfect opportunity for you. This role will involve a reasonable amount of physical activity, so will enable you to keep your fitness levels high, as well as helping your mental health and wellbeing. You will be making a genuine contribution to nature conservation, and you might find it rewarding to safeguard nature in the area you are working to protect. \r\n\r\nWe are a friendly and supportive team, so you might make new friends too. \r\n\r\nIf you are volunteering to learn new skills and gain knowledge about wildlife conservation work, you will find that our team will be more than happy to help you on that journey. \r\n\r\nIn this role you will be helping others to succeed, especially as you induct and train volunteers who are looking to gain skills, this can be extremely rewarding.",

    "description": "Help Save the Slavonian Grebe – Become a Data Volunteer\r\n\r\nSlavonian Grebes are in trouble. Once thriving on over 30 lochs in Inverness-shire, their numbers have plummeted—from 80 pairs in the 1970s to just 20 pairs on 14 lochs in 2024. With support from the Nature Restoration Fund, we’re working to uncover the causes of this decline—and we need your help.\r\n\r\nAs a Data Volunteer, you’ll play a vital role in processing and analysing bird and habitat data collected during the 2025 breeding season. Tasks include digitising survey maps and forms, reviewing trail and underwater camera footage, and recording key observations. Your support will directly inform conservation efforts and help us understand the role of habitat, diet, and environmental pressures in the species’ decline.\r\n\r\nThis is a flexible, home-based role suitable for anyone in the UK with good attention to detail, IT skills, and a passion for nature. We ask for a minimum commitment of 15 hours between October and December 2025. You’ll receive full guidance and support from our friendly project team.\r\n\r\nAs a Data Volunteer you'll help with processing existing data, digitising handwritten maps and survey forms, and to review & analyse trail camera and underwater camera imagery. \r\n\r\nThis role will include the following tasks and the team will provide full training and support: \r\n• Reviewing trail camera images, identifying and recording any birds or mammals or any human disturbance captured by the cameras. \r\n• Reviewing videos captured on underwater cameras and recording the type and number of fish appearing in the videos.  \r\n• Digitising scanned copies of survey maps or forms by entering the data into spreadsheets or databases.  \r\n• This role may be shared between several volunteers assigned to the role \r\n\r\nYou will receive guidance and support from the project team, but we are ideally looking for people with:\r\n• Good communication skills\r\n• Attention to detail and the ability to focus on a task\r\n• Ability to accurately transfer data from a handwritten format to a digital format.  \r\n• IT skills, including creating and managing spreadsheets. \r\n• Good organisational skills\r\n\r\nThis role is primarily a home based role, it can be undertaken from anywhere in the UK and you can mostly carry out the role in your own time. You can carry out this role using your own laptop or computer, equipment can be provided if required. \r\n\r\nYou will receive written instructions and guidance from project staff, they will be on hand to discuss the tasks with you via video call or phone call. Project staff will give guidance and training, we ask that volunteers are able to commit at least 15 hours of their time to this role between October and December 2025. \r\n\r\nMake a real impact for nature—join us in protecting one of Scotland’s most iconic birds.",

    "description": "Rathlin Island is home to Northern Ireland’s largest seabird colony, with over 200,000 birds, including the largest Guillemot colony in the UK and Ireland and over 1,000 Puffins. However, these populations are under serious threat from invasive non-native predators—rats and ferrets—which prey on seabird eggs, chicks, and adults. \r\n\r\nIntroduced unintentionally in the 1800s (rats) and deliberately in the 1980s (ferrets), these predators have significantly impacted Rathlin’s wildlife. For example, Puffin numbers have halved since 1985, with chick survival rates dropping from 75% in healthy environments to just 33%. The Corncrake, another vulnerable ground nesting bird, is also at risk. Rathlin remains the only breeding site for Corncrake in Northern Ireland. \r\n\r\nAn incursion is when a non-native invasive mammal has recently spread to the island but has not yet established a population. As part of the shared protection plans, we are building a network of trained volunteers to respond to an incursion and react rapidly to any reported invasive predator and remove this threat as quickly as possible.  \r\n\r\n**We will provide training and host occasional team days**, but you will **only be called upon in the event of an incursion**. We do not expect that everyone will be available all the time, but by having a large network of volunteers we aim to ensure that we have enough when needed. \r\n\r\nDepending on your skill set and interests there may be other tasks you can help the team with such as more regular surveillance checks, reviewing trail camera footage, constructing wooden rodent motels, or helping with maintenance and stock takes of hub equipment. Awareness raising is an important way of improving biosecurity, so any way you can help with this, be it through communicating with your friends/family or at a larger public event would be much appreciated.  \r\n\r\nAs a LIFE Raft biosecurity volunteer, you’ll be part of something big – a team of amazing and dedicated people who donate their time, energy, talent and skills to help birds and other wildlife. We will help you gain skills and give you an invaluable insight into essential biosecurity work.  \r\n\r\n**What you will be doing**\r\n\r\n- Routinely checking the permanent monitoring loops to see if there are any signs of rats. This means checking monitoring station based around Rathlin in the routes most likely to have a rat incursion.  \r\n\r\n- Contacted if an incursion has occurred, likely at short notice.  \r\n\r\n- Assist with practical on-the-ground incursion conservation work. This will involve the active control of invasive predators, by use of traps or rodenticide if there is an incursion. \r\n\r\n- You will be involved in setting out and checking equipment (monitoring/poisoning/trapping equipment) in the first 48hrs of any incursion response. \r\n\r\n*If you are not a Rathlin resident it will be possible to carry out day trips, you may also be required to stay on island, if necessary, accommodation will be provided. You will be working alongside other volunteers, RSPB NI staff and key stakeholders as a team.*\r\n\r\nOther tasks you may have the opportunity to get involved with if you are interested include helping at events, reviewing trail camera footage, constructing wooden rodent motels, or helping with maintenance and stock takes of hub equipment. \r\n\r\n**The skills you need and the skills you can bring**\r\n\r\nThe Island incursion role is varied, and the list below is an example of the type of skills required but not all are necessary, there are other aspects to the role which may be more suited to you. Everyone will bring a range of valuable skills so come and have a chat with our Biosecurity Manager to see if this role is for you. \r\n\r\n- Follow procedures required for the removal of invasive predators and learn necessary monitoring skills required.  \r\n\r\n- Able to attend required training and follow health and safety requirements. Work as part of a team of 3-8 people to carry out the main tasks.  \r\n\r\n- Be flexible and adaptable to change. \r\n\r\n- Have a friendly nature and be able to communicate effectively with people.  \r\n\r\n- Physically able to embark and disembark boats– including small tenders and where no hard slipway is present.  \r\n\r\n- Comfortable moving across rugged terrain in all weathers, including slippery rocks, steep slopes and at a safe distance from cliff edges.  \r\n\r\n- Be able to carry equipment across rugged terrain – as a minimum 5 – 10kgs (this would include personal equipment, food/drink, and incursion response materials).  \r\n\r\n- Able to camp, if necessary and cook as part of a rota for other team members. \r\n\r\n- Maintain any equipment provided. \r\n\r\n- Carry out responsibilities in an environmentally aware manner, ensuring as little damage to the environment as possible. Our aim is to ensure all resources are used effectively and efficiently.  \r\n\r\n**What's in it for you** \r\n\r\nBiosecurity on Rathlin is a shared sense of responsibility to ensure the island remains invasive predator free long after the LIFE Raft project is completed, by being involved you will: \r\n\r\n- Be helping to save some of our most iconic seabirds in one of the most spectacular locations in Northern Ireland and enable some ground nesting birds to breed and increase in numbers. \r\n\r\n- Be part of a team to help maintain the legacy and socio-economic benefits of maintaining an invasive predator free status along with the residents of Rathlin \r\n\r\n- Gain valuable experience and training in implementation of biosecurity measures  \r\n\r\n- Meet and work with other passionate volunteers and staff expert in the biosecurity field  \r\n\r\nIf you volunteer for LIFE Raft, the RSPB will reimburse you for travel and subsistence expenses, we will provide you with the equipment, training and any PPE needed for you to complete the role.",

    "description": "Rathlin Island is one of Northern Ireland's most treasured wildlife havens, home to internationally important seabird colonies and unique native species. To help keep the island free from invasive predators like rats - which can devastate nesting birds - we are building a network of trained biosecurity volunteers. This is your chance to play a vital role in safeguarding Rathlin's natural heritage while spending time in one of the most beautiful and diverse places in the country.\r\n\r\n**What you will be doing**\r\n\r\nYou will be starting out as a LIFE Raft volunteer and this role will then become a biosecurity volunteer. You will carry out monthly checks of one of five biosecurity loops, checking for signs of rodent activity. You'll monitor tracking tunnels, bait stations, chew blocks, and record your findings to help us respond quickly if rats are detected. **We'll provide full training** and you will be apart of occasional team days for refreshers, updates and the chance to connect with staff and other volunteers.\r\n\r\nDepending on your availability and interests there may also be opportunities to:\r\n\r\n- Review trail camera footage for signs of wildlife or rats\r\n- Construct or maintain monitoring stations\r\n- Help with equipment stock-takes and record keeping\r\n- Support awareness, whether by chatting to friends and family or helping at public events\r\n\r\n**Skills you'll need**\r\n\r\nYou don't need previous experience in conservation or biosecurity - just:\r\n\r\n- A keen eye for detail and willingness to learn\r\n- A love for nature and the outdoors\r\n- A reasonable level of fitness (some loops involve uneven ground)\r\n- Ability to commit to one check per month, with flexibility\r\n\r\nWe don't expect everyone to be available all the time - that's why we're building a large, flexible team to ensure coverage when it's needed most. \r\n\r\n**What's in it for you**\r\n\r\n- Be part of a vital conservation effort that makes a real difference \r\n- Learn new skills and gain hands on experience in biosecurity monitoring\r\n- Spend time outdoors in a stunning natural environment \r\n- Meet like-minded people \r\n- Receive full training and support \r\n\r\nIf you are not a Rathlin resident it will be possible to carry out day trips. However, you may be required to stay on the island and accommodation will be provided in this event.",

    "description": "Get into the festive spirit by volunteering at X Factor's G4’s Christmas Concert. Hear wonderful renditions of Christmas classics, even join in on a few tunes yourself, all while supporting the charity Missing People. This is a fantastic opportunity to volunteer at a truly enjoyable evening so don’t miss out.\n\nPlease register through the application form here - https://forms.volunteero.org/view/a7f14263-69dc-4ad8-9d40-f33f0bac4de0\n\nVolunteers will be acting as ushers, showing guests their seats on arrival. You will also be helping to collect donations during intervals and at the end of the night, standing around the venue holding a bucket or tap to donate card machine.\n\nFor each venue, we also need a Lead Volunteer. This involves collecting and counting the cash donations at the end of the night and transferring to the charity the following day. You would receive specific instructions for this.\n\nNo training is needed for the role. You will receive a simple email briefing a few weeks in advance, and a full briefing from the team on your arrival on the night.\n\nThe event is from 19:30 – 21:30, but we’d ask for you to arrive at the venue from 18:00 and expect to finish at 22:00. Dates across November & December, around UK. ",

We will also provide you with a supportive environment while you are volunteering with us. Information about our volunteer roles are included in the role descriptions. What you can expect from SJA, and what we expect from those who volunteer with us, is included in the volunteer charter.\n\nCome and join your local St John Ambulance Network, and help to promote the charity's work and assist with demonstrations.\n\n\nYou will be expected to attend our Community Engagement events, and help to promote our work, and to help with fundraising. Also you will need to be able to talk to the public about what we do, and to try to get some new volunteers.\n\n\nYou will need to come to our Devizes location, and join in and meet with our Team.

    "description": "Do you love Minecraft and want to make a difference to the lives of children with Autism, ADHD, PDA and SEND, and get paid for it?\n\nWe are recruiting for experts who are enthusiasts in Minecraft to work on a 6 month Community Tech project – developing a Minecraft server for use by community groups who work with Neurodiverse children. Fully remote role.\n\nWe know the power that Minecraft has to change lives, and have seen it again and again in our Minecraft groups for children with SEND. We have seen confidence grow, friendships form, new opportunities open up for children, all due to the common ground and power of Minecraft in our Minecraft social sessions for children with SEND. Our sessions are so important to the kids who attend and they look forward to them all week – even taking their laptops on holiday to attend! \n\nSetting up a secure, private, Minecraft LAN gaming environment can be intimidating, confusing and expensive.  Parents are often unable to let their children play online when their children are more vulnerable.\n\nThis project will create a server capable of hosting private worlds for community groups, shared worlds and mini games, and teach community group leaders how to play and ideas to lead sessions for the children, and demystify the world of Minecraft and servers.\n\nWe are looking for people who have expertise in:\n\n \n\nMinecraft server configuration\n\nPlug in writing and management\n\nCoding \n\nMinigame Building\n\nWorld Edit\n\nCommand Blocks\n\n Master Builders\n\n \n\nThe aim of this program is create a resource that can be used by community groups to support the children’s wellbeing, education and building friendships. This six month period will be spent creating, developing, and testing ideas as part of a team, leading to the creation of a server than can support multiple community groups to have their own private space, along with common areas and mini games for children to meet safely and play together.  There will also be the opportunity to upskill community group leaders to lead their own sessions for the children on the server.\n\nVolunteer Roles – Leading/Assisting Minecraft Build & Play Session\n\nIf you love playing Minecraft but might not have the technical skills above, we would welcome you to apply to join us to support the children in their social sessions – for a maximum of 6 hours per week (typically one hour per week), to assist or lead Minecraft Social Build & Play sessions with the groups, which take place daytimes, evenings or weekend mornings.\n\nAny successful applicant working with children will be required to undertake an Enhanced DBS check and NSPCC Online Tutor Training, arranged by Creative Active Lives.

    "description": "Do you have a passion for organising social groups and meeting new people? Want a flexible voluntary role that allows you to make a difference to peoples’ lives? Then this is for you!\n\nWe are looking for volunteers who enjoy meeting and talking to new people and would be willing to help us set up a new group in their area.\n\nWhat would I do?\nFollowing the success of the new groups in Hertfordshire, we are recruiting volunteers across the country to set up new NWR groups in their area.\n\nThese NWR groups will meet for conversation and informal discussions in a local cafe or pub with a set theme – this theme acts as an icebreaker and ensures that no two meetings feel the same! Themes could cover a wide range of topics and are designed to be light-hearted and an opener for conversations that could lead anywhere (and usually do!).\n\nYour role would be to run the meetings – greeting new and existing members, ensuring that the meetings run smoothly and everyone feels welcome, included and is having fun.\n\nYou would be asked to:\n• Work with NWR staff to identify which town/city to base your group in\n• Consider the types of women who would be interested in your group. What would suit them in terms of the time, location and format of the meetings? How should we communicate to them about the new group? Our staff will be able to provide guidance using their wealth of experience in setting up and running groups.\n• Schedule meetings and identify and arrange a suitable venue.\n• Run the meetings, ensuring that everyone is made to feel welcome and has an opportunity to contribute if they want to. Promote the benefits of NWR membership.\n\nWe will:\n• Offer you ideas and advice in all areas of running the meetings and managing the group.\n• Write and launch a social media and marketing campaign to recruit members for your group.\n• Respond to enquiries and maintain lists of those interested in attending.\n\nThe amount of time spent will vary from week to week. It is estimated that it will require 2 hours a month. The hours are flexible and can fit in with your existing commitments.\n\nThis opportunity is open to women living in the UK over the age of 18 who are able to travel to the meetings in the evening.\n\nTravel expenses will not be reimbursed.\n\nYou will be provided with full training and support from NWR staff and will be part of a friendly and supportive network of volunteers from across the country.",

We are a distinct service operating as part of the national charity Family Action. \n\nWe improve the emotional well-being and life chances of children and young people who are facing multiple disadvantages on a daily basis. We provide the vital support these children need to brighten their experience of childhood and build resilience for the future, by matching them with friendship mentors who give one-to-one support for at least two years. We accept referrals for children and young people aged 5-16 in London.\n\nThe children and young people we help have a range of problems to deal with, such as living with the after-effects of domestic violence or alcohol and drug misuse, or supporting parents with mental health problems. Some of the young people have mental health issues themselves; some have learning difficulties or are struggling at school; others are caring for disabled or ill relatives at home. \n\nWhatever a child�s particular circumstances, regular contact with a mentor provides the extra support and friendship they need to help them manage everyday life, explore new interests, have fun, develop life-skills and build the resilience they need to cope with adversity and lead a fulfilling adult life. \n\nOur volunteers receive ongoing training and support from our dedicated team of professional caseworkers, who are always on hand to offer advice and guidance.",

    "description": "Could you help to raise vital funds for SSAFA in your local area? You don’t need a military background, just the ability to get on with all kinds of people and some occasional free time. \n\nWhat is a Branch Fundraiser? \nAs part of a local team, our fundraisers represent SSAFA at events, and in public. The role includes helping at fayres, street collections, concerts, quizzes, raffles, sporting events etc. \n\nWhy do we need you? \nWe’ve been supporting the Armed Forces community since 1885. Our clients come from all backgrounds and age groups and may have served in WW2 or in a more recent conflict like the Falklands or Afghanistan. \n\nThere are SSAFA branches throughout the UK and overseas who support local volunteers to deliver services to veterans, serving personnel and their families. Some branches are divided into smaller divisions to ensure the best local service delivery. Each branch has a team of volunteer caseworkers, support volunteers, executive roles, and fundraisers.\n\nSSAFA branches rely on regular charitable income to fund all the necessities behind our support for clients. This includes volunteer travel expenses, phone bills, publicity, and grants for clients in urgent need. A varied programme of fundraising also keeps the SSAFA profile high in the local community, so everyone knows who we are and how we can help. \n\nWhen would you be needed and where would you be based? \nThis role involves being out and about at public events and would suit someone looking to give the occasional day, half day or evening to support SSAFA; when and where would be flexible to suit you. \n\nWhat would you be doing? \n•\tBe part of a team with collection/buckets tins at events, supermarkets, shopping centres, etc. \n•\tActing as a marshal at a public event e.g., handing out water to runners, supervising parking etc. \n•\tBeing part of a team running a stall at an event, Armed Forces Day, fayre, county show etc. \n•\tHelping with putting up posters, building gazebos, serving refreshments, packing/unpacking cars etc. \n•\tBeing a positive ambassador for SSAFA, engaging people of all backgrounds and interests \n•\tVolunteering within the standards and values of SSAFA including observing our policies such as the Volunteering policy and data protection policy (these will be covered in your training and local induction.) \n\nThe remit of this role may change over the next 12-18 months depending on the outcome of a trial currently being undertaken.\n\n\nWhat can you gain from this volunteering role? \n•\tUse your skills, knowledge, and life experience to benefit others. \n•\tGive tangible and practical support to your local branch by raising funds used directly to support clients. \n•\tSupport from your local SSAFA branch and the wider SSAFA community \n•\tExperience, training and skills that you can highlight on your CV and in job interviews. \n•\tBetter physical and mental health – studies show that volunteers live longer and experience lower levels of stress and depression! \n\nWhat training and support would you receive? \n•\tRole specific training to prepare you for your voluntary role - fundraising workshops. \n•\tMandatory on-line training modules to complete at home, so you are up to date on how to keep clients, their families safe and personal information safe. \n•\tAccess to a range of e-learning courses, fundraising guidance, and marketing materials \n•\tLocal Fundraising Coordinator \n•\tFundraising Manager (per region) \n•\tAccess to the Fundraising and Marketing teams based at our central office. \n•\tReimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses \n•\tVolunteers will be covered by SSAFAs Public Liability Insurance whilst carrying out the role.\n\nWhat are we looking for? \n•\tFriendly and approachable people \n•\tConfident people who feel happy to engage with the public, potential clients, volunteers and SSAFA colleagues face-to-face. \n•\tReliable attitude, staying connected the Fundraising Coordinator about your availability. \n•\tAbility to maintain confidentiality and keep information safely. \n•\tAccess to public transport or a car to get to events.\n\nWe welcome volunteers of all backgrounds, abilities, races, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds, and of all faiths and none.

Every year, SSAFA helps more than 82,000 people from the Forces family to get back on their feet; those currently serving, reserves, veterans and their families. Support is there for people at any stage in their military career; from the youngest recruit to the oldest veteran – no one’s service is ever forgotten. We give hope, help and personal support for as long as it takes to get that person’s life back to where they want it to be\nSSAFA was established in 1885 and has been working tirelessly to support those in the UK Armed Forces ever since.  We support thousands of people in the UK and on military bases around the world. We understand the unique demands of service life, whether it’s on UK soil or overseas. We have more than 4,000 trained SSAFA volunteers who provide personalised, face-to-face support to those in their local area.\nOur trained welfare advisors and volunteers work with each person to find out exactly what they need. Once we’ve assessed what is required, we’ll help the individual or family access appropriate support. This may just be someone to listen to them, but, more often than not, we access financial assistance from statutory and military benevolent funds or foundations that we work with. In addition, we signpost to our other charity partners who can give much needed assistance to help people get their lives back on track.\nWhatever they’re facing our Forces and their families can rely on SSAFA. Whether it’s financial, practical or emotional, we provide the right kind of support, for as long as it takes to get that person’s life back to where they want to be, ensuring their independence and dignity is protected at all times.\n",

    "description": "Could you help to raise vital funds for SSAFA in your local area? You don’t need a military background, just the ability to get on with all kinds of people and some occasional free time. \n\nWhat is a Branch Fundraiser? \nAs part of a local team, our fundraisers represent SSAFA at events, and in public. The role includes helping at fayres, street collections, concerts, quizzes, raffles, sporting events etc. \n\nWhy do we need you? \nWe’ve been supporting the Armed Forces community since 1885. Our clients come from all backgrounds and age groups and may have served in WW2 or in a more recent conflict like the Falklands or Afghanistan. \n\nThere are SSAFA branches throughout the UK and overseas who support local volunteers to deliver services to veterans, serving personnel and their families. Some branches are divided into smaller divisions to ensure the best local service delivery. Each branch has a team of volunteer caseworkers, support volunteers, executive roles, and fundraisers.\n\nSSAFA branches rely on regular charitable income to fund all the necessities behind our support for clients. This includes volunteer travel expenses, phone bills, publicity, and grants for clients in urgent need. A varied programme of fundraising also keeps the SSAFA profile high in the local community, so everyone knows who we are and how we can help. \n\nWhen would you be needed and where would you be based? \nThis role involves being out and about at public events and would suit someone looking to give the occasional day, half day or evening to support SSAFA; when and where would be flexible to suit you. \n\nWhat would you be doing? \n•\tBe part of a team with collection/buckets tins at events, supermarkets, shopping centres, etc. \n•\tActing as a marshal at a public event e.g., handing out water to runners, supervising parking etc. \n•\tBeing part of a team running a stall at an event, Armed Forces Day, fayre, county show etc. \n•\tHelping with putting up posters, building gazebos, serving refreshments, packing/unpacking cars etc. \n•\tBeing a positive ambassador for SSAFA, engaging people of all backgrounds and interests \n•\tVolunteering within the standards and values of SSAFA including observing our policies such as the Volunteering policy and data protection policy (these will be covered in your training and local induction.) \n\nThe remit of this role may change over the next 12-18 months depending on the outcome of a trial currently being undertaken.\n\n\nWhat can you gain from this volunteering role? \n•\tUse your skills, knowledge, and life experience to benefit others. \n•\tGive tangible and practical support to your local branch by raising funds used directly to support clients. \n•\tSupport from your local SSAFA branch and the wider SSAFA community \n•\tExperience, training and skills that you can highlight on your CV and in job interviews. \n•\tBetter physical and mental health – studies show that volunteers live longer and experience lower levels of stress and depression! \n\nWhat training and support would you receive? \n•\tRole specific training to prepare you for your voluntary role - fundraising workshops. \n•\tMandatory on-line training modules to complete at home, so you are up to date on how to keep clients, their families safe and personal information safe. \n•\tAccess to a range of e-learning courses, fundraising guidance, and marketing materials \n•\tLocal Fundraising Coordinator \n•\tFundraising Manager (per region) \n•\tAccess to the Fundraising and Marketing teams based at our central office. \n•\tReimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses \n•\tVolunteers will be covered by SSAFAs Public Liability Insurance whilst carrying out the role.\n\nWhat are we looking for? \n•\tFriendly and approachable people \n•\tConfident people who feel happy to engage with the public, potential clients, volunteers and SSAFA colleagues face-to-face. \n•\tReliable attitude, staying connected the Fundraising Coordinator about your availability. \n•\tAbility to maintain confidentiality and keep information safely. \n•\tAccess to public transport or a car to get to events.\n\nWe welcome volunteers of all backgrounds, abilities, races, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds, and of all faiths and none.

Every year, SSAFA helps more than 82,000 people from the Forces family to get back on their feet; those currently serving, reserves, veterans and their families. Support is there for people at any stage in their military career; from the youngest recruit to the oldest veteran – no one’s service is ever forgotten. We give hope, help and personal support for as long as it takes to get that person’s life back to where they want it to be\nSSAFA was established in 1885 and has been working tirelessly to support those in the UK Armed Forces ever since.  We support thousands of people in the UK and on military bases around the world. We understand the unique demands of service life, whether it’s on UK soil or overseas. We have more than 4,000 trained SSAFA volunteers who provide personalised, face-to-face support to those in their local area.\nOur trained welfare advisors and volunteers work with each person to find out exactly what they need. Once we’ve assessed what is required, we’ll help the individual or family access appropriate support. This may just be someone to listen to them, but, more often than not, we access financial assistance from statutory and military benevolent funds or foundations that we work with. In addition, we signpost to our other charity partners who can give much needed assistance to help people get their lives back on track.\nWhatever they’re facing our Forces and their families can rely on SSAFA. Whether it’s financial, practical or emotional, we provide the right kind of support, for as long as it takes to get that person’s life back to where they want to be, ensuring their independence and dignity is protected at all times.\n",
