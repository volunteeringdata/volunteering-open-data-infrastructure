They can raise valuable funds and encourage local support as well as inspire others to help us. We are looking to establish a national network of groups.\r\n\r\nWhat do groups do?&nbsp;Groups raise valuable funds for Medical Detection Dogs. Group members decide on ways to fundraise and organise their own events with support from Head Office or, where possible, Regional Fundraisers.\r\n\r\nWhat is expected of a branch?&nbsp;Anything you raise is brilliant and valuable to the charity. The important thing is for each group to decide on an achievable goal and for everyone to enjoy what they are doing. As long as it is legal, have a go!\r\n\r\nHow many people make a support group?&nbsp;Fundraising can be hard work and it takes motivated and willing volunteers to set up a local fundraising group. Groups can vary in size and initiators can recruit as many or as few group members as they like, but really the more the better!&nbsp;If you are interested in or starting a joining a Regional support group please contact our Volunteer Coordinator&nbsp;Email&nbsp;volunteering@medicaldetectiondogs.org.uk&nbsp;or telephone 01296 655888\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",

Then find out how you can volunteer with The Reader.\r\n\r\nThe Reader is based in Liverpool and works across England and Wales to set up Shared Reading groups.\r\n\r\nShared Reading is a great way for people to meet up and read and listen to brilliant stories and poems. Then we talk about them. There&#39;s never any pressure&nbsp;to read aloud or talk. Listening is fine too. And we can talk about them in any way we want to. They might spark a memory or there might be a character we like, or a word or phrase that stands out.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe already suppport Shared Reading in Warrington Hospital and LifeTime Gateway and we&#39;re looking to expand our work in Warrington so we are looking for new volunteers to help start groups as Reader Leaders. New groups might be in community centres, cafes, a bookshop or other places. We find the locations and set it all up - although suggestions for new venues are always welcome. Perhaps you know somewhere.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll our groups are led by Reader Leaders. A Reader Leader gets full training and ongoing support from our excellent team.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo volunteer with us, you have to enjoy reading a wide variety of material. You have to&nbsp; be available 4 hours per week or fortnight to prepare and deliver a session. Training is&nbsp;on Zoom, for 6 half day sessions over 6 weeks. Groups are held in weekday daytimes - so this is when you have to be available.&nbsp;\r\n",

    "description": "We are a local branch of&nbsp;An Comunn G&agrave;idhealach which is a company limited by guarantee and a voluntary membership organisation, with charitable status, founded in Oban in 1891 as a vehicle for the preservation and development of the Gaelic language.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt actively encourages the teaching, learning and use of the Gaelic language and the study and cultivation of Gaelic literature, history, music and art.&nbsp;An Comunn Gaidhealach founded&nbsp;&nbsp;a Gaelic Festival modelled on the Welsh Eisteddfod&nbsp;in 1892. This Festival was called&nbsp;The M&ograve;d&nbsp;and it is a result of considerable&nbsp;endeavors that now, over 100 years later due recognition has been granted to the Mod in the form of the Royal&nbsp;assent. The Festival is now&nbsp;The Royal National M&ograve;d.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Charity No. is SCO01282.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe Association is usually referred to as &ldquo;An Comunn&rdquo;, the Association. For many throughout the world An Comunn is the body which represents the Gaelic language.\r\n\r\nAs a local branch we create opportunities to celebrate and promote Gaelic language and culture such as the Oban &amp; District Provincial Mod which is a smaller version of the National Festival. A lot of our volunteers do not speak Gaelic and there is no requirement to speak the language in order to support and promote it.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES OF AN COMUNN G&Agrave;IDHEALACH\r\n\r\nThe aims of the Association are to support and develop all aspects of the Gaelic language, culture, history and heritage at local, national and international levels by:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPromoting the use of the language in everyday community life.\r\n\tPromoting the study and development of Gaelic language, literature, music, drama and all other related art forms.\r\n\tActively seeking official recognition and use of Gaelic as a living language and national asset by local, national and European Governments and other agencies, by co-operating with all other organisations engaged in the provision of Gaelic language and culture\r\n\tAn Comunn G&agrave;idhealach is non-political and non-sectarian, and membership is open to anyone sharing the above objectives\r\n\r\n",

This is the oldest building in the city still in use for its original purpose.&nbsp;It has a long and rich history intimately interwoven with that of Chester itself.\r\n\r\nThe SJP support takes two forms: managing a small cafe and shop and providing a guide service for visitors to the church. We need volunteers to help with both of these activities in a number of ways. The Church is open to visitors from 10 a.m. until 4p.m. Monday to Saturday (11 to 3 in winter). Sunday is for worship only.\r\n\r\nCafe and Shop\r\n\r\nThe cafe offers hot and cold drinks and packaged snacks at very reasonable prices from a purpose-built area within the church; while the shop provides a range of souvenirs and other articles.&nbsp; There are also hundreds of second-hand books and magazines for sale.\r\n\r\nGuide Service\r\n\r\nThere has been a church on this site since for almost 1400 years and the present church dates from 1075. So, there is an enormous fund of stories to tell.&nbsp; These have been condensed into a structured guided tour which is offered free to visitors.\r\n\r\nVolunteering Opportunities\r\n\r\nWe need enthusiastic people who can:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAssist with the Cafe and Retail area;\r\n\tBe part of the Visitor experience in our Tour Service*;\r\n\tHelp with administration duties;\r\n\tDevelop and maintain our social media offerings;\r\n\tAssist&nbsp; with fund-raising; and\r\n\tGet involved in new schemes and projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n*Full training will be provided\r\n\r\nFor an Application Form email:&nbsp;office@stjohnschester.uk\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",

We support under-resourced children and young people aged 0 to 18 with their confidence and skills around creativity and writing.\r\n\r\nWe introduce children, young people and families to discover creativity and imagination through artists, one-to-one mentoring and exciting projects which spark motivation to write. We know that strong writing skills and an ability to imagine beyond what we experience are fundamental to future success. We also believe it is important for young people to see a real reason to write so there is always an outcome from the activities we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe are a story destination for all ages in our &lsquo;Apothecary to the Magical&rsquo;. As you enter you are immediately transported into a world of wonder and enchantment. Warm greetings from friendly shopkeepers take you on a tour of wild schemes, mysterious plots and kitchenware.&nbsp; We encourage you to visit the UK&rsquo;s one and only&nbsp;&lsquo;Apothecary to the Magical&rsquo;&nbsp;visible to humans in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nLittle do you know there&rsquo;s a secret door, hidden within the shelves, that takes you on a further journey of awe and wonder, starting with the imagination gym for dusting off old apathy and unleashing hidden creativity. Once the imagination is sparked one can climb the giant&rsquo;s bookcase through the corridor of glory, past Graham and Grizelda&rsquo;s office, glimpsing at the Writers&rsquo; Closet, through to the Writers&rsquo; Pad.\r\n\r\nGrimm &amp; Co is built on a foundation of research that defined the way we work. Our model of working is also inspired by the 826 Valencia model and we are a member of the Ministry of Stories family &ndash; sharing practices, keeping our offer fresh, exciting, on mission and relevant. Dave Eggers also tells the story about 826&rsquo;s inspiration, early beginnings, and ensuing momentum in a&nbsp;TED Talks&nbsp;video.\r\n\r\nGrimm &amp; Co is a literacy charity that relies on an amazing team of volunteers.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have a little free time on your hands (even just one morning or afternoon each month) and you&rsquo;d like to get involved with what we do, we&rsquo;d love to welcome you on board. No matter where your skills and interests lie, we&rsquo;ll have a role that suits you!&nbsp; Have a read of the volunteer roles on our website and see what you think.&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteering - Grimm &amp; Co - Come and join our team (grimmandco.co.uk)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",

We do this through three key programmes: educational mentoring, educational progression and wellbeing. REUK is also involved in research,&nbsp;consultancy, and advocacy, and runs training for practictioners.\r\n\r\nThe educational mentoring programme offers bespoke educational mentoring&nbsp;to young refugees, asylum seekers and survivors of trafficking across Oxford, London, the West Midlands and the East of England. This is the key area where REUK relies on volunteers, to support young people with 1:1 weekly sessions as their mentors.\r\n\r\nHow does mentoring work?\r\n\r\n- REUK&nbsp;takes referrals of young people from schools and colleges, social services and a variety of other organisations and individuals\r\n- We meet the young person for an initial assessment of their educational aspirations and current circumstances\r\n- We match the individual young person with a trained, local volunteer mentor (this could be you!)\r\n- The mentor meets the young person for an hour each week, in a public place, to support them towards their educational goal\r\n- We ask for a minimum commitment of six month from both the young person and the mentor. After six months the relationship is reviewed to see if both mentor and mentee would like to continue\r\n- The REUK local Mentoring Coordinator provides continued support to mentor and mentee all along their relationship\r\n",

    "description": "The idea of developing this project came from my clinical observation. I am a CBT therapist and a psychologist, and while treating people with depression, I have noticed that some people struggle to engage in pleasurable activities. The treatment for depression consists of engaging in pleasurable activities and cognitive restructuring. People struggle with the first part of the intervention because they don&#39;t like to do activities alone or don&#39;t know what they like. So, the idea of this project is to offer CBT sessions where people will learn how to moderate their mood. We will complement the therapy by offering a green space where they can access a wide range of pleasurable activities such as gardening, arts and crafts activities for the garden, building and creating things in the garden such as creating a fire pit, sitting areas, water features and lots more. On top of this, the participants would be part of a small group of people struggling with similar emotional difficulties, which will help normalise their experience and allow them to learn how to accept and regulate their feelings\r\n",

We work with some of the most vulnerable children in the Liverpool-Merseyside area: children in care, some who have been abused, young carers, and children living in poverty or overcrowded accommodation. These children are referred to us by parents, social workers and other organisations because they desperately need a break from their home lives. For some, it is the one chance they get each year to be a child.\r\n\r\nWhen asked why Campus is so special, a word that constantly comes up is community. Lots of Campus kids return to the same project each year from the age of 6, providing them with much needed stability in their positive relationships with the adult volunteers. When they reach 13, many stay on to become Young Helpers themselves, and are trained to volunteer on the projects that they benefited from.\r\n\r\nMore information on our projects and volunteer roles can be found on our website:&nbsp;https://campusholidays.org.uk&nbsp;\r\n",
