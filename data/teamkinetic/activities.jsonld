    "description": "What you&rsquo;ll be doing\r\nAs a Farmland Bird Survey Volunteer, you&rsquo;ll volunteer with the Trust&rsquo;s Farm Advice Team (Wilder Landscapes) to monitor bird populations on farms across Suffolk. Using standard breeding bird survey methods, you&rsquo;ll visit host farms during the breeding season (between April and July) to identify and record farmland bird species. These surveys help chart changes over time and assess the impact of wildlife-friendly farming practices such as hedgerow management, supplementary feeding, and wild bird seed provision. Your records are then shared with conservation partners to help shape future land management advice.\r\n\r\nWhat you&rsquo;ll get out of it\r\nThis is a hands-on, meaningful way to contribute to farmland bird conservation in Suffolk. You&#39;ll take part in real-world ecological monitoring, strengthen your bird identification skills and see firsthand how changes in farming practices influence wildlife. Working alongside experienced volunteers and Trust staff provides a welcoming learning environment and connects you with others passionate about conservation. Plus, your contributions help guide practical habitat enhancements across the county, making a long-lasting impact for both wildlife and farmers.\r\n\r\nThe time you need to give\r\nVolunteers are asked to make two visits to each assigned farm during the breeding season, typically between April and July. These surveys are repeated every three years at the same sites to track changes and trends in bird populations over time. This schedule allows flexibility while ensuring the data remains valuable for long-term monitoring.\r\n\r\nOur EDI Statement\r\nSuffolk Wildlife Trust is committed to an inclusive and diverse workplace where everyone is welcome. As a conservation charity, we recognise the importance of diversity in both nature and our workforce of staff and volunteers. We strive to ensure that everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute to our vision of &ldquo;A Wilder Suffolk where nature is thriving and abundant because everyone is doing more to help&rdquo;.\r\n",

Do you have great listening skills and an ability to remain calm during stressful situations?\r\rIf so, then you may be interested in becoming an Emergency Community Response Volunteer. We are looking for residents who would like to help their neighbourhood should an emergency occur in their local area.\r\rAs we enter the winter months, we would like to create a team of Emergency Community Response Volunteers who will provide practical assistance to the Council’s work with communities affected by an emergency such as a fire, flood, or mass evacuation of a building.\r\rFortunately, major emergencies are rare but when they do occur there are many ways we can support those affected. The valuable contribution of a network of trained volunteers can help to make a real difference during an emergency.\r\rVolunteers may be asked to consider volunteering:\r- At or near the scene of an emergency.\r- At any assistance point or relief centre established.\r- Remotely, from home or another location sharing information, for instance amongst their network and supporting vulnerable residents. \r\rIt is difficult to determine in advance exactly the types of tasks that will present themselves during a major emergency, so a flexible approach and positive attitude is required.\r \rWe envision volunteers may be asked to;\r- Support Rest Centres following mass evacuations, a fire, flood or building evacuation.\r- Support residents who have been evacuated by handing out blankets, cups of tea/coffee and act as a listening ear.\r- Door knocking to check if residents require any support for instance following a flood.\r- Supporting Rest Centres and emergency services using their local knowledge.\r\rVolunteers will receive full training, a site walk and appropriate supervision. Personal Protective Equipment will be provided and is to be worn correctly to ensure the safety of volunteers, staff and residents.\r\rIn the event of an emergency in the borough, volunteers who have expressed an interest will be contacted to see how they can support the community response. If you are interested in getting involved, please sign up to our expression of interest here. We will release more information towards the end of the month. If you have any questions in the meantime, please contact us at wflegends@groundwork.org.uk\r\rThis role is covered by the Parking Exemptions policy which means that volunteers do not have to pay for parking if they are driving as part of their volunteering role.",

As a volunteer mentor, you&rsquo;ll play a vital role in helping women feel more connected, supported, and confident as they build new lives within their local community.\r\n\r\nRefugee women often face a range of complex challenges, from isolation and language barriers to trauma and limited access to services. As a mentor, you&rsquo;ll provide a safe, welcoming space where your mentee can talk openly about her experiences. Through active listening and consistent encouragement, you&rsquo;ll support her mental wellbeing and help her find pathways to greater inclusion.\r\n\r\nYou&rsquo;ll empower your mentee to explore opportunities for connection and belonging, encouraging her to engage with local groups, build social networks, and access relevant community services. Where appropriate, you may also signpost her to specialist organisations for additional support.\r\n\r\nAs a volunteer, you&rsquo;ll:\r\n\r\n- Offer regular, compassionate support to a refugee woman through one-to-one mentoring.\r\n\r\n- Provide a listening ear and safe space to share experiences and explore challenges.\r\n\r\n- Encourage social connections and greater confidence in navigating community life.\r\n\r\n- Signpost to specialist services when needed.\r\n\r\nBy volunteering with Unfold, you&rsquo;ll be helping to break down the barriers that keep refugee women excluded from mainstream support, making a lasting difference in one of the most vulnerable communities. Unfold hopes you can offer your time regularly, but this is entirely flexible and at your discretion.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;d like to help create a more inclusive and supportive community, register your interest today and start your journey as a mentor with Unfold.\r\n",

    "description": "Volunteers at our nature discovery centres welcome visitors to the centre, talk about the site and Essex Wildlife Trust Membership options, operate the till for retail and catering sales, restock shelves, prepare hot and cold refreshments as well as general duties around the centre.\r\rBackground detail\rBelfairs Nature Discovery Centre is a visitor, community and education centre. It is an important gateway to the Belfairs & Daws Heath Living Landscape, in south Essex, where Essex Wildlife Trust and Southend-on-Sea Borough Council are working, together with many partners and local people, on conservation and education activities, to preserve this fantastic landscape for future generations. The striking, wooden-clad building has been constructed sympathetically to its environment. Inside, there are an education hall (also available to hire as a meeting hall), shop, information displays and refreshments area.\r\rBelfairs Woodland Centre introduces visitors to the 1160-acre Living Landscape, a third of which is woodland, including a number of outstanding sites valuable for nature conservation. It is a crucial green lung surrounded by urban areas and provides a tremendous green space of great importance to local people of the Boroughs of Southend and Castle Point.\r\rMuch of the woodland is officially ‘ancient woodland’; some is more than 1,000 years old, making it the earliest woodland recorded in Essex. The woodlands are home to a number of historic landscape features and a wide variety of flora and fauna, including several nationally-threatened species.\r\rOur centres are not for profit making. All money raised goes directly back into managing conservation across Essex.\r\rTime commitment\rOur nature discovery centres are open all year round from 10:00am until 5:00pm (4:00pm in the winter months) except Christmas Day and Boxing Day. We are looking for volunteers who are available for either full or half days.\r\rRole description\r- Welcoming visitors to the centre.\r- Assist the catering team including stocking refrigerators, taking orders, preparing food, serving food and clearing tables.\r- Operating the till for catering sales.\r- A welcoming and friendly face to greet visitors to the centre.\r\rEDI Statement\rEssex Wildlife Trust is committed to an inclusive and diverse workplace where everyone is welcome. As a conservation charity, we know how important diversity is, both in our natural world and amongst the people who choose to volunteer with us. We want everyone to feel valued and empowered to contribute to our vision of “A county rich in wildlife with people connected to nature”.",

    "description": "Volunteer Befrienders required to spend around an hour a week providing friendship to someone (usually elderly) who is experiencing loneliness and/or social isolation in the Upper Eden area.\r\n\r\nOur volunteer befrienders are matched with someone experiencing loneliness and provide friendship in the form of a weekly home visit. Most visits are face-to-face although some people prefer a telephone conversation. We ask for an initial commitment of 6 months (but understand that circumstances can change).\r\n\r\nLoneliness in the UK is recognised as a public health crisis with 13% of people feeling lonely all of the time. 49% of older people say the TV is their main form of company. Conversation is known to reduce loneliness and improve peoples&#39; health and well-being.\r\n\r\nMolly: &ldquo;Honestly and truly, you&rsquo;ve no idea how much I look forward to (her) coming. She&rsquo;s like a ray of sunshine. It&rsquo;s made a big difference to my life. She&rsquo;s always smiling, always pleasant.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWendy: &quot;Volunteering with Linking Lives is definitely a two way blessing. It&#39;s a privilege to be able to take an hour or so each week and just listen. I&#39;ve already learnt a lot about &quot;shunting&#39; trains and how to &#39;tickle a trout&#39;! We all have a story to tell...we just need someone to be able to share it with.&quot;\r\n",

    "description": "The extra help and support from corporate volunteer days help to push this special community project forward. Olden would love to invite your team along on this journey to help enrich the gardens. Tasks will depend on priorities at the time, but there will be a variety for people to get involved in. Previous teams have helped with things like painting, filling steps with shingle, creating dead hedges, building composters, planting, cutting back greenery, and general site upkeep.\r\rAbout Olden Community Garden:\rOlden is one of Islington’s hidden gems. The two-acre garden is an important green space and resource for the local community. As many of us have come to appreciate over the last few years, community gardens are an amazing asset that provide opportunities for all communities to improve their health and wellbeing. It is also a haven for biodiversity and wildlife and has been designated as a site of scientific interest as part of Islington Council’s Biodiversity Action Plan.\r\rOlden has deep roots and connections with the wider community, with connections to 20 local community groups of different kinds. For example, the nearest primary school uses the woodland for forest schools, and there is a greenhouse and food growing area whose produce goes to other nearby schools and community centres. \r\rOver 2,500 visitors enjoy the garden every year, with 2,200 of them from Islington. Olden would really appreciate support from corporate volunteer teams to expand the project and continue to support local communities.\r\rVolunteer capacity: 6 - 15 volunteers\r\rDates: Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, or Fridays\r\rTime/Duration: 9:30am - 4pm (flexible). Half days are also possible.\r\rLocation: Olden Community Garden, opposite 22 Whistler St, London, N5 1NJ\r\rCharitable donation towards materials and operation costs: £320 for up to and including 8 volunteers, £40 per volunteer thereafter.\rThis covers anything that might be needed for the day itself, as well as a general donation to the ongoing operational costs of the charity.\r",

    "description": "Understanding visitors, their experiences, motivations and expectations is a crucial part of National Museums NI&rsquo;s activities, It contributes to a process of continual improvement ensuring we remain relevant to our visitors and do our best to help them explore, engage and enjoy their heritage.\r\n\r\nThis is an opportunity for volunteers to support the Audience, Insights and Planning team by discreetly observing and recording how visitors engage with specific galleries in the Ulster Museum, beginning with the Saints &amp; Scholars gallery.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to identify which displays, objects and interpretive features attract attention or are overlooked - &#39;hot spots&#39; and &#39;cold spots&#39; - and how different audiences use the space.\r\n\r\nYour role would be to gather evidence on visitor behaviour &mdash; including movement, dwell time, and interaction &mdash; to inform future gallery redevelopment and enhance storytelling, accessibility, and audience engagement. This is a fantastic opportunity to gain first hand experience in audience research and museum visitor studies, and contribute to future visitor experiences.\r\n\r\nTime Commitment\r\n\r\n\r\n\tMinimum one 2 hour shift per week.\r\n\tYou can attend any time during opening hours\r\n\tYou are required to log your hours on the system after each shift\r\n\tTo book a shift, simply choose a day you&#39;d like to attend and drop in for any minimum&nbsp;2-hour period between 10am and 5pm. Shifts are flexible to suit your schedule and help us gather data across various times during the week.\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOther Points of Note\r\n\r\n\r\n\tVolunteers must be 16+\r\n\tWhen conducting onservation studies&nbsp;you will be working alone but a member of the visitor guide team will be available nearby and you can ask for help if any issue arises.\r\n\tThe Duty Manager will be the main&nbsp;point of contact during your shift\r\n\tAn Access NI check is required for this role (your application will not be approved until this has been processed)\r\n\r\n",

    "description": "Why am I needed?\rCommunity is at the heart of everything that we do at Tenovus Cancer Care to help those affected by cancer. Our aim is simple – to deliver a vision where fewer people get cancer and those that do receive equal access to excellent treatment. However, we can’t do this without your help. Our shops in local communities are crucial to us raising vital funds. So, we’d like you to volunteer your time and commitment to help us make a difference. We need you to help sort, value and display our book donations in our shops to help turn them into cash.\r\rWhat will I be doing?\r• Sorting through our book donations and pricing them ready for sale\r• Researching interesting books online on sites such as eBay, Amazon and Abe Books to value them for sale in the shop\r• Displaying the books on the shop floor ensuring books are rotated regularly to increase sales\r• Enlisting help from local auction houses when needed\r• Speaking with customers, making them welcome and answering queries\r• Promoting awareness of the charity and the services that we provide. \r\rYou may need to handle bags and donations from the public and there may be stairs to climb depending on which shop you are based in. If you have any concerns about this, please speak with the Shop Manager when expressing your interest in volunteering.  \r\rHow much time do I need to commit? \rWe’d need you to give around three hours per week if you can with the possibility to do more if you’d like to. However, we appreciate any time you’d like to give; please let us know this on your application form. \r\rWhat support will I be given?\r• Before starting with Tenovus Cancer Care, we ask that you do try a small number of hours in the shop so we can both see how the role may suit you. The amount of hours can be decided between you and the Shop Manager.\r• Following that the Shop Manager and team will be on hand to run you through the basics of helping in a shop in your first few days and they’ll always be on hand after that.\r \rBecoming a volunteer with Tenovus Cancer Care can be a rewarding experience and is certainly invaluable to the charity and its goals.\r\rInclusivity: \rWhether you’re a volunteer, supporter, or staff member, we want everyone to feel welcome at Tenovus Cancer Care. We are committed to greater diversity across our people to make sure we have a breadth of experience, skills and perspective that reflects the communities we serve.\r\rWe are working to ensure that Tenovus Cancer Care is a fair and equitable place to volunteer. We strive to ensure everyone is treated fairly, regardless of age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity, race (which includes colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins), sexual orientation, religion, or belief, or because someone is married or in a civil partnership.",

    "description": "This opportunity is for someone who loves telling stories! All you need is a little bit of social media knowledge (Instagram is our main platform right now) and some great ideas for how to represent our choirs week to week.\r\n\r\nDigital Storytellers tend to post approximately once a week, capturing behind-the-scenes content from rehearsals eg warm ups, people catching up, mealtimes, whole choir singalongs and even the washing up! They might also collect pictures and videos from other members of the community, to remember fun things which heppened in the past year, to shout about an incredible performance or gig, or to talk about some of our fundraising activities.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis role is ad-hoc, and it&#39;s ok to start, or stop at any time. It can be really nice to work as part of a team, and your Choir Manager is on hand to support getting other people involved. For example, you may want to talk to camera and need someone to record you. Or you may be more of a behind-the-camera person, and want to ask some people to feature in a video. You might also want to write some text to go with photos which people have sent you. There&#39;s loads of ways to get involved!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",

If you can spare a few hours a week, or a couple of hours occasionally, we’d love you to join our volunteer team. \r\rIf you’d like to make a difference behind the scenes, if you’re a keen rummager or if you like things to be neat and tidy, then we have a role for you - helping in our BHF shop stock room. If you love a bit of ironing, then master the clothes steamer and watch those wrinkles disappear (it’s surprisingly therapeutic!), or become a clothes tagger extraordinaire, allowing customers to understand what item they are purchasing. If you want a hands-on volunteer role behind the scenes or just fancy the company of other friendly volunteers our shop stock room is the place to be.  \r\rJust so you know, we are unable to accept volunteers aged under 17 or with unspent criminal convictions. Please note this is an unpaid voluntary position in a friendly charity shop.\r\rTypical tasks include:\r\rPreparing donated items for sale\rUsing a clothes steamer\rAttaching labels and tags to donated items ready for sale\rIdentifying unsaleable donations for recycling\rKeeping the sort room organised and tidy\r \r\r",

Together you&rsquo;ll chat, share stories, play fun literacy games, and build a positive relationship that grows throughout the year.\r\n\r\nYour encouragement will help children who may be struggling with reading, language, or confidence. Over time, you&rsquo;ll see them flourish as they gain skills, self-belief, and a genuine love of books. The difference you make will run through every part of their school life and beyond.\r\n\r\nWe ask volunteers to commit to one school year and to be reliable for their weekly sessions. In return, you&rsquo;ll receive full training, ongoing support, and access to a treasure trove of brilliant resources.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re someone who enjoys being with children, loves reading, and wants to give back to your local community, this could be the perfect role for you!\r\n",

The only attributes we ask for is that you are non-judgemental,\rgenuinely interested in the interests and aspirations of others and keen to\rmake a genuine difference\r\rWHAT WILL YOU BE DOING?\rWe would like you to meet a client for 1 – 2 hours each week either in person or\ron-line. You will provide them with individual support in line with their\rbespoke Employment & Learning Action Plan.\rBe able to commit at least 1 hour a week to your client for up to six months.\rSupport your mentee to reach the targets outlined in their Action Plan\rBe able to encourage and motivate your client.\rSend a short progress report to the E&L Manager once a month which can\rinclude suggestions for improving the service or requests for support.\rParticipate in the Centre induction and safeguarding training.\rAttend any Volunteer Mentoring training or meetings when you are\ravailable. Alternatively, you might prefer to read the guidance notes or\rservice updates that we will send out after each training sessions or\rmeetings.\r\rWHO WILL YOU BE HELPING?\rThe Employment & Learning Team support young people and families across\rWestminster with support and services to inspire them to reach their full\rpotential. Some of the people we work with have never had a job or have not\rmanaged to keep in employment for long. Others are young people about to\rfinish A-levels who would like a mentor to help them research and apply for\runiversity entrance. We support mums keen to return to work and parents\rwho have had established careers which, for various reasons (pandemic,\reconomic challenges) are no longer viable. Many underestimate the skills they\rcan offer an employer, and most will need confidence boosting and help with\rnetworking to improve their self-esteem.\r\rWHAT IS THE TIME COMMITMENT?\rWe ask that you can commit a minimum of 1 hour a week to meet, either in\rperson or online, for a period of between 3 and 6 months.. Should you choose\rto meet the client in person, we can arrange to book a room.). Alternatively,\ryou can make private arrangements with the client directly",

Volunteers will get involved in a variety of activities designed to engage the children, including arts and crafts, games and quizzes. Specific tasks that the volunteers will be involved in are setting up the youth club, helping the children do arts and crafts, leading group games, handing out food and refreshments to the children, and clearing up at the end. Volunteers will always be supported by a member of staff so they will never be asked to oversee the youth club or volunteer alone. Volunteers are not required to volunteer every week but most weeks. We normally have four volunteers per session, so we can organise a rota system. We will provide Child Protection and Safeguarding training. Volunteers must be friendly, confident and have good communication skills when engaging the children. The volunteer should be enthusiastic and enjoy working with young people.",

Together they have fun, tackle any issues the young person may be facing and celebrate achievements along the way.\r\n\r\nWe match young people up with mentors for a two year period as change can take time, and since our young peoples&#39; lives have had multiple fractured relationships, we&#39;re careful to create lasting and meaningful ones. All young people setting up home for the first time face challenges that are difficult to deal with alone, having a friendly trusted person to turn to can be life changing.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s lots of laughter and light in our training cohorts. We get to know you as a person, and the team bonds, and enjoys each others company, learning about ourselves and each other as well as how to support our young people. The content is interesting and impactful, covering the care experience, trauma, boundaries, safeguarding, mental health and lots more beside.\r\n\r\nWe run two 8 week training cohorts per year in Salford, on Thursdays 6-9pm.

We are actively encouraging applicants from ethnically diverse backgrounds and other minoritised groups to apply as we are currently under-represented in this space.&nbsp; You will get to meet the inspirational faces of community groups across the UK and immerse yourself in their work; use your existing skills in a rewarding fashion whilst developing new ones; guide members to become more inclusive; network with other like-minded individuals helping grassroots sports groups survive; and so much more.\r\n\r\nOur volunteers say that making a positive difference to our members is what they most enjoy about volunteering at Sported.\r\n",

The programme ran last year for the first time, working with young people from Durham City Youth Club to teach DJing skills across a series of weekly sessions. This year we hope to expand the programme to another youth club, based outside Durham City, and collaborate with DJs from Rotate Durham. We also plan to host a &lsquo;show-case&rsquo; event at the end of the programme, where the kids can show off the skills they have learnt!\r\n\r\nVolunteering with the DJ School can include many different things! If you have a lot of experience DJ&#39;ing, you may be able to help teaching the kids. If not, no worries! There are equally important volunteering roles helping with the kids during the sessions, playing games and getting involved with the music!\r\n",

Any specific training will be outlined within your onboarding and induction stages and then discussed at your reviews with your named lead contact.\r\rAll materials to support your role will be supplied by Deafblind UK, including a fundraising pack with ideas for raising money and all the information you might need. The Fundraising Team will also be on hand to provide ongoing support, advice, and guidance.\r\rDeafblindness affects everyone in different ways. Some people might have mild sight and hearing loss whereas others can’t see or hear anything.

    "description": "One of nature&rsquo;s greatest gifts is its ability to inspire, relax, and educate. Suffolk Wildlife Trust&rsquo;s reserves provide the perfect setting for teams to get involved with local conservation or simply to unwind in beautiful surroundings. Our exclusive programmes are designed to foster wellbeing, teamwork, and learning by immersing your team in peaceful, wildlife-rich places.\r\n\r\nThrough our Wild Work Days, your team can get hands-on with conservation, taking part in practical tasks such as reed cutting, fence building, habitat creation, or wildlife surveying. For a gentler pace, our Wild Wellbeing Days focus on the restorative benefits of nature, offering guided walks, mindfulness, and space to reconnect with the outdoors. Meanwhile, our Wilder Knowledge Days provide opportunities to learn about Suffolk&rsquo;s natural environment and ecology, equipping your team with environmental insight that can boost sustainability.\r\n\r\nWhichever option you choose, your team will make a direct impact for Suffolk&rsquo;s wildlife while demonstrating a clear commitment to supporting local people and nature. These days help strengthen team bonds, improve wellbeing and give colleagues the chance to enjoy time in some of the county&rsquo;s most beautiful landscapes. At the same time, they contribute to your organisation&rsquo;s ESG goals, making them a rewarding choice for both team building and corporate volunteering.\r\n\r\nFor more information and to book, please visitor our website: suffolkwildlifetrust.org/corporate/team-building.&nbsp;\r\n",

They give around 2-3 hours a week of their time to support a young person age 16-28 who needs a consistent reliable adult for practical and emotional support. They work on a 1:1 basis with a young person who has left or is about to leave care (a children&#39;s home or foster care). Together they tackle any issues the young person may be facing and celebrate achievements along the way.\r\n\r\nYoung care leavers need access to consistent reliable adults in the local community to focus on any practical or emotional needs. We match young people up with mentors for a two year period as change can take time, and since our young peoples&#39; lives have had multiple fractured relationships, we&#39;re careful to create lasting and meaningful ones. All young people setting up home for the first time face challenges that are difficult to deal with alone, having a friendly trusted person to turn to can be life changing.\r\n\r\nOur training is really impactful, and teaches you about trauma, the care experience, boundaries, safeguarding, mental health and lots more beside. We run two 8 week training cohorts per year in Congleton, Tuesdays 6-9pm. The cohort intakes are March and September.\r\n\r\nFor more information please go to&nbsp;Get Involved | Pure Insight\r\n\r\nOr get in touch for a chat&nbsp;Expression of Interest | Pure Insight\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n",

    "description": "Do you love walking in the countryside on a sunny day? Can you identify the most common butterfly species that we have here in Yorkshire? If so, the role of butterfly surveyor could be perfect for you.\r\rWith rapid life cycles and often high sensitivity to environmental conditions, butterflies are uniquely placed amongst terrestrial invertebrates to act as indicators to environmental changes. As a result, butterfly surveys are a key ecological monitoring program on Yorkshire Wildlife Trust reserves. Collecting data on the species present, as well as the abundance of these species over time, allows us to identify trends. Thes trends help to inform us on how best to manage reserves, for example:\r\r- If data shows a species is in decline; we can investigate what may have caused this and consider what actions might be needed to halt or even reverse it e.g., habitat creation, or changes in management practices. \r\r-If data shows a species is thriving; this may prompt research into why that might be and if there are lessons we can take and apply at other reserves.\r\rAdditionally, the data collected through the butterfly surveys is shared with The Butterfly Conservation Trust through entry into the United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UK BMS) database and thus contributes to a national monitoring initiative. The result of which is a knowledge base that, amongst other things, informs government policies addressing environmental issues. \r\rSo, whether you are a life-long butterfly enthusiast or someone who has only recently come to appreciate their beauty and importance, we would love to hear from you. Butterfly surveying is a great way to learn about and enjoy nature, get some exercise, and fill your lungs with fresh air. \r",

This could be anything from our bird life and bug life to deer grazing impact and camera trapping! Your surveys will be fundamental in helping us understand the biodiversity and bioabundance on our site.\r\rYou’ll work with Heal’s Ranger to organise and conduct surveys including methodology, data collection, data submission to appropriate bodies, and regular liaison about when you’ll be out on site. \rOur aim is for surveyors to be as independent as possible, whether on your own or with a group of fellow volunteers.  \r\rThis is a general role which encompasses many different types of species and habitat surveys, each with their own individual skillsets and risks when surveying. Some of the skills required are only desirable for specific surveys or sub-roles.\r",

    "description": "Volunteer at City Harvest London, a fast-moving food redistribution charity rescuing food from going to waste and delivering, for free, to 375+ charities across London.\r\rAcross the UK, the cost-of-living crisis has created a food emergency. Currently, 1 in 4 Londoners are struggling to afford to eat. Yet London produces nearly 2 million tonnes of food waste each year. City Harvest rescues nutritious food from going to waste and we need your help to get it to those communities who rely on our support.\r\rVolunteer roles with City Harvest are critical to our impact. For every hour you volunteer, City Harvest is able to deliver enough food for 530 meals. Without the time and support of our volunteers, we simply could not do this!\r\rVolunteering at City Harvest is also a lot of fun! According to a recent survey, 100% of our volunteers would recommend our volunteer experience!\r\rThe Role: \rEvery volunteering experience with City Harvest is different. There is huge flexibility depending on the amount of time you can commit. Roles assigned will depend on the time of day and where the need is greatest. \rCurrently we are seeking the following roles: \r\rWAREHOUSE ASSISTANT \r• unloading deliveries \r• creating mixed trays of food \r• quality control: checking and grading fresh food \r• helping to load vans \r• daily warehouse tasks \r\r*Due to the nature of our operation, current roles all require standing, walking, and lifting. Manual handling training is provided, and staff will be on hand to support you. \r\rOur Locations:\rOur operation is spread across 2 London locations: \rActon: multiple slots per day (between 8am – 8pm), 7 days a week \rNew Spitalfields Market: weekday morning slots, Mon - Thurs\r\rYour Impact: \rYour contribution will have a direct social and environmental impact: preventing harmful greenhouse gas emissions from food waste and getting nutritious surplus food to people who need it most. Volunteers are the life and soul of all we do at City Harvest: the packers, the stackers, the sorters, and the porters. We couldn’t do what we do without the support from amazing people like you! \r\rOur Commitments: \rCity Harvest is committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and diverse environment for our volunteers and staff, where people are treated equally, and we are transparent about our intentions and goals. The City Harvest Volunteer Team are here to support you, so please reach out to provide feedback and express any ideas or concerns\r\rANY QUESTIONS?\r\rIf you have any questions, queries, or would like to discuss this further, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at volunteer@cityharvest.org.uk and we will be happy to help.",

For young asylum seekers in particular, this can mean supporting someone through the complexities of adjusting to life in a new culture, far from familiar surroundings.\r\n\r\nThrough regular meetings, you&rsquo;ll offer:\r\n\r\n- Emotional, social, and practical support to build your mentee&rsquo;s confidence and independence.\r\n\r\n- Encouragement to explore future options and set meaningful goals.\r\n\r\n- Guidance in developing strategies to achieve those goals.\r\n\r\n- Support in making social connections with local groups, services, and the wider community.\r\n\r\nMentoring with Unfold is not only impactful for the young people involved&mdash;9 out of 10 report significant improvements in their lives&mdash;but also deeply rewarding for you. You&rsquo;ll grow alongside your mentee, gaining fresh perspectives and developing transferable skills such as empathetic leadership, communication, and adaptive thinking. Whether you&#39;re mentoring someone your own age or from a very different background, this role invites you to reflect, laugh, learn, and inspire one another on the journey to positive change. Unfold hopes you can offer your time regularly, but this is entirely flexible and at your discretion. If you&#39;re ready to support a young person and grow through the experience together, register your interest to become a mentor with Unfold.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFurther info on where the opportunity takes place\r\n\r\nIn person session will take place near to where your mentee lives, primarily within Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea boroughs, we do welcome mentees from the surrounding boroughs.\r\n",

    "description": "Every home at the Trust has a garden for our residents to enjoy. Many of our residents spent many happy hours tending to the garden, tinkering in the shed or growing veg.\r\n\r\nAs every gardener knows, it&rsquo;s a hobby that can bring a great sense of satisfaction but also, sometimes, sore muscles. Our volunteer Gardeners are the people who make the residents gardens their own when they can no longer dig and plant themselves.\r\n\r\nOur Gardeners have a passion for seeing things grow. Most of our gardeners enjoy involving people, getting them involved in planting seeds and agreeing which plants go where. Some of our gardeners just enjoy the satisfaction of knowing they&rsquo;ve created a space people can relax in and enjoy.\r\n\r\nOur Gardeners are part of the Home Team. As gardening can be an activity and a maintenance role, Gardeners are involved with both the Activity Co-ordinator and the Handy Person. Our Gardeners understand that gardening at home and gardening in a care environment are different and they are extra mindful of the health and safety risks we need to watch out for. They also recognise that the gardens are not their own and check in before they act. Nobody wants to move a plant out of the sight of someone it means the world to.\r\n\r\nThis role is flexible and will depend on you and the need we have at the time. There are peak seasons so you&rsquo;ll probably do more in during those busy times but there is something to be done all year round.\r\n\r\nYou&rsquo;ll build up relationships with people and the Home Team so ideally, we&rsquo;d like a regular, longer term commitment of a couple of hours a week. Days and times are flexible; talk to us and we&rsquo;ll see what suits us both.\r\n",

Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by an adult, and anyone requiring assistance will bring their own carer.\r\n\r\nVolunteer car drivers must own their own car and have a full driving licence. All expenses are reimbursed (45p per mile for miles where the vehicle is empty, 50p where there are passengers). \r\n\r\nThe scheme is flexible and allows you to run errands whilst volunteering, which can help towards the cost of your own fuel.  You will be offered either ad-hoc or regular transport requests, which you can decline if you are busy, or suggest alternative times/days if you could not meet the customer request.  Customer requests are given to you via a Volunteer Co-ordinator.  You may request how you like to receive this (email, phone call etc).\r\n\r\nIf the journey requires a long waiting time, you can go home in-between where again you would be reimbursed the fuel.\r\n\r\nWe welcome as many volunteer drivers as we can find, as we generally cannot meet all customer requests asked of us.  \r\n\r\nWe hold annual meet ups where you can meet other volunteers in your area.\r\n\r\nThe most common reason why people volunteer with us is so that they meet new and interesting people locally and give something back to their community.\r\n",

Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust manages sessions for the Dean Green Team, and we&rsquo;re always looking for new volunteers to join us in this rewarding work across multiple reserves.\r\n\r\nWhether you&#39;re a seasoned conservationist or brand new to habitat restoration, we&#39;d love to have you on board. No experience is needed, just a willingness to get stuck in! The work takes place at a variety of nature reserves throughout the Forest of Dean and Lower Wye area, where we focus on creating and maintaining vital habitats to benefit local wildlife.\r\n\r\nWe use a mix of hand tools to remove scrub, clear overgrowth, and keep these spaces open and thriving. All tools and protective gloves are provided, and any work requiring power tools is carried out by GWT staff. Once the scrub is removed, stumps are spot-treated with herbicide to prevent regrowth, and any cleared material is either burned or stacked to create habitat piles.\r\n\r\nWe typically meet at 9:45 AM, with sessions running until 2:30 PM. Each session includes a 30-minute tea break and a 45-minute lunch break&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no pressure to stay the entire time, just give as much time as you&#39;re comfortable with. Location details will be provided before each session.\r\nWhat should you bring? Please bring your own food and drink, as well as sturdy boots and clothes you don&rsquo;t mind getting dirty. Depending on the weather, we recommend bringing wet weather gear or extra layers to stay comfortable.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re interested in helping conserve these special places or just want to learn more, please get in touch! You can also visit the Dean Green Team&rsquo;s website at www.deangreenteam.co.uk to learn more about the group and its work in the forest.\r\n",

However please DO NOT send in a recording without registering your interest in the first instance and without being given the guidance regarding video format and submission security. Guidance will be provided by the PE Team once you have registered your interest. \r\rThose who do participate will be paid under the Trusts R&R Policy at the standard rate and automatically give their consent to filming/being identified, thus the story being shared within the Trust.

    "description": "We are a charity organisation that provides inclusive cycling sessions for individuals of all abilities and ages.\r\rWe’d love to welcome you down to a session, where you can find out more about volunteering with us. \r\rOur Croxteth Park sessions run every Monday between 10am - 2pm.\r\rAt Wheels for All our volunteers support people like Owen (case study by Owen’s dad): \r\r“Owen is a 29-year-old man with severe autism and other disabilities. He had typical development as a child but developed encephalitis and had other factors that led to his challenges. Being active and out and about in the community is very important to Owen and us but we have struggled finding activities that are inclusive and welcoming. Wheels for All provides all this and more for Owen.\rThe staff and the volunteers are very kind and helpful and it’s so much fun for him too. Socially, we and Owen have made several good friends there so it’s a great social thing too!\r\rWhen Owen was younger someone once said, “well it’s unlikely he will ever ride a bike and be that independent”. At Wheels for All he has that freedom on the adapted trike to enjoy his independent mobility. There is nothing about Wheels for All that is not beneficial for Owen it helps his cardiovascular fitness, his flexibility, and the strength in his legs. Most importantly of all it allows him to participate like anyone else with a little adjustment.\r\rThis is a wonderful charity that has made a difference to Owen and our lives, and we are lucky to have access to it. Many with physical and learning disabilities are not encouraged or supported to do physical activity and post pandemic we still see a lack of sufficient support and opportunity. Wheels for All is a fantastic charity and improves Owen’s life.\r\rIt is true enablement in action!&quot;\r\rTo anyone who hasn't volunteered at a Wheels for All session yet, go along and have a look, its nice to see so many happy faces. If you can’t volunteer for the full session, just help out for the time you can, to see all the happy faces is priceless and it’s so rewarding to see the difference you can make! \r\rVolunteering is perfect for making new friends, learning new skills, and developing new interests while helping us to provide cycling opportunities for everyone but the elderly, disabled people, and those with long term health conditions. \r\rWhy not come along to our Croxteth Park sessions to have a friendly chat with our coordinator and see one of our sessions first hand.",

If so, how about becoming a Reserve Ranger.\r\rWe are looking for regular site visitors to be our eyes and ears for your local site, enabling us to ensure the plants and animals are being looked after in the best way possible.\r\rWhat’s involved?\rInitially, a member of the Conservation Team will show you around the site and provide information on important things to look out for.\r\rYou would then undertake subsequent visits at your convenience and complete a simple report to highlight any issues or maintenance required.\r\rYou may be required to coordinate your site visits with other Reserve Wardens.\r\rOpportunities for surveying and reporting on nature and wildlife are encouraged.\r\rSome practical work such as litter picking, or removal of some invasive non-native species can also be undertaken as part of your warden visits - full training and tools will be provided.",

    "description": "We&#39;re looking for volunteers who would like to get involved in gardening across the Warley Place reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Work Party is on Monday morning 08.30 - 1.00pm.\r\n\r\n- Volunteering in the garden.\r\n- Willingness to be outdoors.\r\n- Following advice from the site Warden.\r\n- Utilising a variety of hand tools to help complete tasks.\r\n- Ensure that the work carried out is efficient and the gardens are left safe and tidy for visitors.\r\n- Following Essex Wildlife Trust Codes of Good Practice, and help promote these motivating and supporting other volunteers.\r\n- Enthusiasm, a positive attitude and an ability to work well with people from a variety of backgrounds is essential.\r\n- Will usually require own transport to site, on some occasion&rsquo;s volunteers may be willing to car- pool.\r\n- Volunteers work at their own pace and be comfortable in taking breaks when needed.\r\n- Sturdy work boots or wellies is required and clothes you don&#39;t mind getting muddy and dirty, plus water and food.\r\n\r\nBackground detail\r\nEssex Wildlife Trust has 87 Nature Reserves, two Nature Parks and manage 8,400 acres of land. Work Party Volunteers manage our nature reserves alongside the Volunteer Wardens and Essex Wildlife Trust Conservation team.\r\n\r\nLocation\r\nWarley Road, Great Warley, Brentwood, CM13 3HU\r\n\r\nMiss Ellen Willmott remodelled the gardens and introduced into them a vast assortment of new plants from all over the world. Some are still found on the reserve.\r\n\r\nThe garden had fallen into neglect but has now been restored by an enthusiastic team of volunteers, although not in its original form. Part of the buildings remain and can still be seen and some areas are dangerous because of hidden cellars, water holes and decaying walls.\r\n\r\nWarley Place with its show of blooming spring flowers - from snowdrops to daffodils and crocuses then bluebells - is a spectacular sight to see. Also, look out for the Magnolias and Camellia, Winter Aconites, Anemones, Foxgloves and Ferns, which grow in profusion. Among a variety of trees, some exotic, is a line of huge Sweet Chestnuts. The reserve attracts a wide variety of birds, including the Nuthatch, and has a good selection of invertebrates including an excellent variety of meadow and woodland butterflies. Areas have also been adapted as very suitable bat habitats\r\n\r\nEDI Statement:\r\nEssex Wildlife Trust is committed to an inclusive and diverse workplace where everyone is welcome. As a conservation charity, we know how important diversity is, both in our natural world and amongst the people who choose to volunteer with us. We want everyone to feel valued and empowered to contribute to our vision of &ldquo;A county rich in wildlife with people connected to nature&rdquo;.\r\n",

    "description": "We are looking for volunteers to join the work party Gunners Park Nature Reserve in Shoeburyness.\r\rThe nature reserve incorporates the Shoebury Old Ranges Site of Special Scientific interest (SSSI) and the Coastguard Station Grounds Local Wildlife Site. This area has more than 12 habitats to walk through, from coastal grassland and a large pond to remnant sand dunes and historic military buildings. This mosaic of habitats has allowed a range of species to thrive here, including the nationally scarce sandwich click beetle, bulbous meadow grass and the cuckoo wasp. The historic buildings are also used by wildlife – in the summer months look out for barn swallows zipping in and out of the gaps to feed their young nesting inside.\r\rBackground detail\rEssex Wildlife Trust has 87 Nature Reserves, two Nature Parks and manage 8,400 acres of land.  Work Party Volunteers manage our nature reserves alongside the Ranger and Essex Wildlife Trust Conservation team.\r\rDue to its proximity to the Thames Estuary, this nature reserve provides ideal habitat for migrating birds on passage to and from the UK, including ring ouzel, spotted flycatcher, wheatear, whinchat and even yellow-browed warbler. Hundreds of waders will gather along Gog’s Berth, while a grey seal occasionally makes an appearance along the seawall.\r\rVolunteers attending scheduled work parties undertake practical conservation tasks such as litter picking, raking, scrub clearance, burning in winter, fence maintenance, projects, habitat pile etc. Training will be provided  including the use of any tools.\r\rLocation\rGunners Park Nature Reserve, Shoebury Common Road (B1016), Shoeburyness, Essex.\r\rTime commitment\rThe work party meets weekly on Tuesdays from 10:00am to 12:00 noon.

Become a Retail Volunteer in one of our hospital cafés and help make the experience a little brighter for NHS staff, patients and visitors.\r\rWe need Retail Café Volunteers to prepare and sell food and drinks to patients, visitors and staff in our hospital and healthcare centre shops. Being in hospital, or visiting someone there, can be a difficult time, so volunteers will need a friendly, compassionate approach when dealing with customers.\r\rYou'll also need a friendly personality and good community and listening skills. This role is great for you if you want to make new friends, and grow your skills and experience in a hospital and retail environment. We also have opportunities available for people with specific skills, so let us know what your strengths are when we meet.",

    "description": "You could be the hero next door!\r\n\r\nYou might feel a need to give something back to your local community or have spare time and would like to use it to do something worthwhile &ndash; whatever your reason for becoming a responder, it is something that will be both rewarding and, at times, challenging.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction of becoming a responder is not just based on saving someone&rsquo;s life, although this is a very special moment should it ever arise. When someone calls an ambulance they are unwell, possibly frightened or unsure of what is happening and vulnerable. Even when dealing with a patient who is not seriously ill, you have the opportunity to calm and reassure them.\r\n\r\nTalking to them and supporting them while they wait for an ambulance is a part of the responder role that is often forgotten or overlooked but it can often be the most rewarding part of being a community first responder.\r\n\r\nAs a responder you step into someone&rsquo;s life for a short period of time, during which you can really make a difference.\r\n\r\nWe will train you to respond to emergencies but you can still go about your normal routine. If we need your help, we will alert you!\r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ll never knowingly send you to an incident where there is any risk or danger to yourself. You&rsquo;ll help patients who are suffering with chest pains, having breathing difficulties, in diabetic emergencies, in cardiac arrest, or who are unconscious or fitting.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re interested just send your name and address to&nbsp;CFR.recruitment@nwas.nhs.uk&nbsp;to find out if we are looking for volunteers in your community.\r\n",

They carry out a variety of different tasks in the Garden. Currently, members of the team are responsible for different areas, though they also work together on certain tasks. Initially, you would be working alongside another volunteer as you learn about the Garden. After a time, you may be able to specialise in a particular part of the Garden that interests you.\r\rWe currently have a team of 7 volunteers working in the garden. Most of them have volunteered for over 10 years and we are now looking for people with gardening experience to join the team to continue their work in the future.\r\rThese are the kinds of tasks that you would be doing:\r\r•Planning and research\r•Maintaining and developing the planting in the beds and pots \r•Keeping the equipment and its storage in good order\r•Maintaining the lawn and keeping paths and parking areas clean and tidy\r•Running a stall of surplus plants for sale\r\rElizabeth Gaskell’s House is a museum and historic house based in Manchester. We celebrate the life and literature of Elizabeth Gaskell, one of the UK’s most important Victorian writers. Elizabeth lived at the House from 1850-65, and two of her daughters continued to live there until 1913. The building itself was restored in the 2000s and finally opened to the public in 2014. The Garden is a key part of our site, and it is entirely managed by a team of volunteers.\r\rThe Gaskell family enjoyed their Garden, and it has been designed with a similar layout to what it would have had in the 1850s. The plants grown in the Garden have been chosen based on what we know about the family’s garden and from research on Elizabeth’s letters, novels and short stories. Wherever possible, plants appropriate to the time period have been used.\r\rVisitors can look around the Garden during our opening hours all the year round, with a Garden Trail available all year round and Victorian garden games for families available in the summer. The garden was awarded Gold at the RHS Britain in Bloom North West Awards in 2023 and 2024.

    "description": "Could you help SSAFA reach more supporters and raise greater awareness of our services through the magic of social media and digital marketing? You don’t need a military background, just some basic digital skills, the ability to get on with a wide range of people and good written English. If you have I.T or digital marketing experience, that would be great but not essential. We’d love you to get in touch to find out more. \r\rWhat is a Digital Marketing Volunteer? \rThere are SSAFA branches and service committees throughout the UK and overseas. We use local microsites and social media to raise awareness of our services, raise funds and find new volunteers. Digital Marketing volunteers help us maximise our message, keep content up to date and increase traffic to our sites. \r\rWhy do we need you? \rWe’ve been supporting the Armed Forces community since 1885. Our clients may have served in WW2 or in a more recent conflict like the Falklands or Afghanistan. \r\rThere are SSAFA branches throughout the UK and overseas who support local volunteers to deliver services to veterans, serving personnel and their families. Some branches are divided into smaller divisions to ensure the best local service delivery. Each branch has a team of volunteer caseworkers, support volunteers, executive roles, and fundraisers.\r\rOur clients, volunteers and supporters come from all backgrounds and age groups and want to engage with us in different ways too. To offer the best possible service we need to provide seamless communication, consistent messages, and accurate information. We’d love to hear from you if think you could help us grow our on-line presence. \r\rWhen would you be needed and where would you be based? \rAs part of your local branch, you might have access to an office, but many volunteers are based at home. \rThe role would suit someone looking for a flexible volunteering opportunity as times and days could fit in around work and other commitments to suit you. \r\rWhat would you be doing? \r•As part of a team of volunteers, maintain branch microsites and social media feeds. \r•Look at ways to increase traffic to microsites and improve SSAFA’s digital brand. \r•Keep content current and accurate. \r•Support and maintain the SSAFA brand by consistently using our brand guidelines and tone of voice.\r•Working with the digital marketing team, interpret analytical data to develop local communication plans. \r•Working with local SSAFA branches, build social media channels and integrate on-line and off-line activity to best effect. \r\rWhat training and support would you receive? \r•Mandatory on-line training modules to complete at home, so you are up to date on how to keep clients, their families safe and personal information safe. \r•Support from our Digital Marketing team based at SSAFA Central Office. \r•Training on our web platform \r•Access to analytical tools and our digital marketing tool kit \r•Induction covering all the aspects of SSAFAs services and the difference we can make to people’s lives. \r•Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses \r•Volunteers will be covered by SSAFAs Public Liability Insurance whilst carrying out the role.\r",

    "description": "Refugee Women&rsquo;s Health Project&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout us:\r\n\r\nThere is a local Healthwatch in every local authority area of England.? Healthwatch Wandsworth is the independent champion for people using local Health and Social Care services in Wandsworth.\r\n\r\nWe listen to what people say they like about services and what could be improved. We then share their views and experiences with the people with the power to make change happen. Healthwatch was given significant statutory powers in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to ensure that the voice of local people is strengthened. Those who pay for, deliver and regulate Health and Social Care services have to respond to what we tell them local people think.\r\n\r\nWe also share the views of local people with Healthwatch England, the national body, to help improve the quality of services across the country.\r\n\r\nHealthwatch is operated by Wandsworth Care Alliance (WCA) a local charity a member-led organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the project:&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting opportunity to support with necessary research that will go on to inform initiatives supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women in our borough.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nVulnerable groups such as refugees and asylum seekers are likely to encounter significant challenges presented by language barriers when accessing health care.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe aim to develop an understanding of the experiences of refugee and asylum-seeking women (as well as women&rsquo;s healthcare staff), who speak little to no English when accessing women&rsquo;s health services. We want to understand the barriers they face and ways in which we can improve their access to these services and reduce health inequalities.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis is an exciting opportunity to support with necessary research that will go on to inform initiatives supporting refugee and asylum-seeking women in our borough.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nRole description:\r\n\r\nCommunity research&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tBriefly explaining to people what Healthwatch is and what we do.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tEncouraging participants to share their views and experiences of local services by helping them to fill in surveys&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tSupport with the facilitation of workshops by registering attendees, explaining information presented and creating a safe, trauma-informed space&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tImpartially recording their feedback with careful consideration for cultural contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nData analysis and report writing&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tSupport with coding and interpreting qualitative data&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tAssisting with report writing&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen necessary, supporting with the dissemination of findings to stakeholders and the wider community&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nEngagement&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tEncouraging people to sign up to be Healthwatch Wandsworth members, to visit our website, to follow us on social media and to come to our Assembly events.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tYou may also be asked to help us find and contact people organising events and community groups, and to help us promote our work and engagement in other ways.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this opportunity, please contact rhiann@wandcareall.org.uk for more information.&nbsp;\r\n",

    "description": "At Derbyshire LGBT+, volunteers are at the very heart of what we do. Our volunteers get involved in all parts of our service, from planning and running events, to representing us at events, meetings and conferences, PSE outreach work, answering our helpline, administration, research and IT support, and being involved in our LGBT+ support and social groups. Being a volunteer here means that you have regular support from the staff, and on-going development and training.\r\rStaff will work with you to help you achieve your goals through volunteering, whether it’s to learn new skills, build confidence, meet new people, gain life experience, or to help Derbyshire LGBT+ support others. There are a variety of short and long term opportunities currently available for people with enthusiasm and time to volunteer for us.\r\rCURRENT VOLUNTEER POSTS\r\rOffice Support Volunteers\rWe are currently looking for individuals that can help us with the day-to-day running of our office. Whether that is admin work, taking inventory or even general office organisation. We are always grateful for any time that someone is willing to give to us.\r\rOne-to-One Listening Ear Volunteers\rThere are times when someone might be struggling emotionally and looking for strategies to help them cope. Or maybe they just need to talk to someone who understands the extra challenges they face as a LGBT+ person and can point them in the right direction to get further support they need. To help, we offer 1-1 appointments for those that are looking for a listening ear, reassurance and practical and emotional support. We are looking for Listening-ear Support Volunteers to help facilitate our 1-1 support sessions and help as many LGBT+ people in need as possible.\r\rGroup Lead Volunteers\rWe run over 40 social and support groups each week and it is thanks to the hard work and dedication of our volunteers that we can do this. We’re looking for Group Lead Volunteers to offer local support for people across the Derbyshire area to help us build, co-ordinate and lead LGBT+ support, social and activity groups. We are looking for individuals that can build on our initial work and continue to ensure that support remains in place. Some administration tasks would need to be completed after every group meeting held.  \r\rGroups included are: \r\r• Women’s Group \r• Men’s Group \r• 18 – 30 Group \r• Transgender Group \r• Over 50’s Group \r• Craft Group \r• Youth Group \r• Mental Health Group \r• Families Group \r\rFundraising Volunteers\rAs Derbyshire’s only dedicated LGBT+ charity, we rely on funding to keep our vital services running. We are looking for volunteers to help us co-ordinate fundraising events, keeping inventory of collection tins and distributing fundraising materials. We are looking for individuals that can work both independently and as a team and have a passion for their community.",

Our aim is simple – to deliver a vision where fewer people get cancer and those that do receive equal access to excellent treatment. However, we can’t do this without your help. Our shops in local communities are crucial to us raising vital funds. So, we’d like you to volunteer your time and commitment to help us make a difference. We need you to help sort, value and display our book donations in our shops to help turn them into cash.\r\rWhat will I be doing?\r• Sorting through our book donations and pricing them ready for sale\r• Researching interesting books online on sites such as eBay, Amazon and Abe Books to value them for sale in the shop\r• Displaying the books on the shop floor ensuring books are rotated regularly to increase sales\r• Enlisting help from local auction houses when needed\r• Speaking with customers, making them welcome and answering queries\r• Promoting awareness of the charity and the services that we provide. \r\rYou may need to handle bags and donations from the public and there may be stairs to climb depending on which shop you are based in. If you have any concerns about this, please speak with the Shop Manager when expressing your interest in volunteering.  \r\rHow much time do I need to commit? \rWe’d need you to give around three hours per week if you can with the possibility to do more if you’d like to. However, we appreciate any time you’d like to give; please let us know this on your application form. \r\rWhat support will I be given?\r• Before starting with Tenovus Cancer Care, we ask that you do try a small number of hours in the shop so we can both see how the role may suit you. The amount of hours can be decided between you and the Shop Manager.\r• Following that the Shop Manager and team will be on hand to run you through the basics of helping in a shop in your first few days and they’ll always be on hand after that.\r• Becoming a volunteer with Tenovus Cancer Care can be a rewarding experience and is certainly invaluable to the charity and its goals.\r\rInclusivity: \rWhether you’re a volunteer, supporter, or staff member, we want everyone to feel welcome at Tenovus Cancer Care. We are committed to greater diversity across our people to make sure we have a breadth of experience, skills and perspective that reflects the communities we serve.\r\rWe are working to ensure that Tenovus Cancer Care is a fair and equitable place to volunteer. We strive to ensure everyone is treated fairly, regardless of age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity, race (which includes colour, nationality and ethnic or national origins), sexual orientation, religion, or belief, or because someone is married or in a civil partnership.\r\r",

    "description": "Do you want to take part in vegan volunteering around your Liverpool?\r\nOur Advocates help out at events, write to their local MP, ask businesses to provide more vegan options, and find places to display our leaflets.\r\n\r\nAdvocates are a crucial voice across Liverpool. They ensure that our campaign messages are spread far and wide.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEvery month, our Network choose from a range of outreach tasks. These could include town centre stalls, writing to a councillor or MP, sharing our campaigns on social media or contacting local businesses. You&#39;re in control of how much or how little you do.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat does the Advocate role involve?\r\nBeing an Advocate for veganism with The Vegan Society will mean communicating with people in your local community. You&#39;ll share the benefits of a vegan lifestyle. You will form part of a local group, headed up by a local Organiser. The Organiser will feed back your collective efforts to staff. You will also be invited to our private Facebook group, for vegan socialising and ideas sharing.\r\n\r\nYou&rsquo;ll stay in touch with the Organiser and bring your passion to tasks. Activities can range from staffing a stall to giving a talk at an employee event. It could also mean writing to a local newspaper or lobbying an MP.\r\n\r\nMessaging can differ every month. Part of our mission statement is to ensure people can remain vegan, so you might focus on getting more vegan options available in local businesses. Or within our Live Vegan for Less campaign, you may share cheap vegan recipes to help people with the cost of living.\r\n\r\nWhen acting as an Advocate, you will use The Vegan Society&rsquo;s branding and messaging guidelines. Your local Organiser will guide you in doing this, as they hold physical resources and handbooks. You can report any issues and feedback you have to your Organiser. You can also contact staff if your Organiser isn&#39;t available or you have any problems.\r\n\r\nWhat training and support is available?\r\nYou will be provided with a big welcome and full induction from your local Organiser. They will introduce you to the group and any actions that are ongoing. Any training and development will be provided via your Organiser, and you can also ask for specific training on any areas that you need some development in.\r\n\r\nWhat skills would be useful in doing this role?\r\nThe ability to stay motivated in order to achieve the best possible outcomes\r\nGood email etiquette, responding in a timely manner\r\nCommitted to veganism and the mission of The Vegan Society\r\nAbility to stay calm if confronted with differing opinions or challenges\r\nA good communicator, with the ability to be persuasive\r\nConfident in communicating with people from a range of backgrounds\r\nExperience of campaigning\r\nAny experience in talking with members of the public through customer/public service would be helpful\r\nAwareness of current affairs, especially those that relate to veganism\r\nRegular availability and a willingness to stay committed to actions\r\nGood team player\r\nHow much time do I need to invest?&nbsp;\r\nFor Advocates, we ask for people to engage in a minimum of four to six actions per year. An example of an action could be writing to an MP or holding a stall. But the more you can do, the better! On occasion, there may also be online meetings to plan for actions or provide training.\r\n",

Meetings are fun and involve the games and exercises we use in our programme (whether online or in person). \r\rAs a voluntary director on our board, you will:\r- Ensure good governance practices and compliance with legal regulations.\r- Provide strategic guidance and input into the organisation’s growth plans.\r- Oversee the financial health of Flower125, reviewing budgets and financial reports.\r- Build and nurture external partnerships with public health organisations, education institutions, and funding bodies.\r- Act as an advocate for Flower125’s mission within your networks and help drive fundraising efforts.\r\rAs a board member, you will:\r- Make a significant contribution to improving the mental health and well-being of young people.\r- Gain valuable experience in strategic leadership and social enterprise governance.\r- Expand your professional network while working with a passionate and driven team.\r",

    "description": "Looking for a rewarding opportunity to support young people in your community whilst developing your own skills and experience?&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAt ReachOut, we believe that socio-emotional skills are overlooked foundational skills which improve success at school and the everyday, personal lives of children. Our aim is to transform outcomes for young people constrained by circumstance by building their socio-emotional skills. We define these skills as empathy, responsibility, problem solving, initiative, teamwork and emotion management.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe exist because not all children have the opportunity to just &lsquo;pick up&rsquo; socio-emotional skills. Just like with maths or English, socio-emotional skills can be influenced by a wide range of formal and informal learning opportunities, which many children just don&rsquo;t have access to the services and opportunities necessary to develop these skills. The 9-14 age bracket is a crucial juncture in childhood development, which is why we focus our efforts on this age range.&nbsp;Our approach combines positive peer support with supportive adult role models, allowing us to have the most impact.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat do volunteer mentors do??&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVolunteer on our after-school projects that take place for 2 hours a week over 12 weeks during term-time. Choose projects that work around your schedule, with projects at our partner schools running on different days.?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur sessions are led by our Youth Development Leads and involve collective mentoring activities from our curriculum and fun group games and activities that develop young people&rsquo;s socio-emotional skills. The role of our volunteer mentors is to get stuck into session activities, typically supporting a small group of mentees, and helping the Youth Development Lead with facilitating activities with your fellow mentors.?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSessions are designed to be exciting and engaging for our young people, so by showing up weekly and bringing confidence and enthusiasm, you&rsquo;ll be helping your mentees to grow in confidence, develop their skills and have fun!&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n",
